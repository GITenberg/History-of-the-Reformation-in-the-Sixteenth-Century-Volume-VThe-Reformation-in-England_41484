<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUME FIFTH.</h2>


<p>In the four previous volumes the author has described the
origin and essential development of the Reformation of the
Sixteenth Century on the Continent; he has now to relate the
history of the Reformation in England.</p>

<p>The notes will direct the reader to the principal sources
whence the author has derived his information. Most of them
are well known; others, however, had not been previously
explored, among which are the later volumes of the State
Papers published by order of Government, by a Commission of
which the illustrious Sir Robert Peel was the first president.
Three successive Home Secretaries, Sir James Graham, Sir
George Grey, and the Honourable Mr. S. H. Walpole, have
presented the author with copies of the several volumes of this
great and important collection: in some instances they were
communicated to him as soon as printed, which was the case in
particular with the seventh volume, of which he has made much
use. He takes this opportunity of expressing his sincere gratitude
to these noble friends of literature.</p>

<p>The History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century
was received with cordiality on the Continent; but it has had a
far greater number of readers in the British dominions and in
the United States. The author looks upon the relations which
this work has established between him and many distant Christians,
as a precious reward for his labours. Will the present
volume be received in those countries as favourably as the
others? A foreigner relating to the Anglo-Saxon race the history
of their Reformation is at a certain disadvantage; and
although the author would rather have referred his readers to
works, whether of old or recent date, by native writers, all of
them more competent for the task than himself, he did not
think it becoming him to shrink from the undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>At no period is it possible to omit the history of the Reformation
in England from a general history of the Reformation of
the Sixteenth Century; at the present crisis it is less possible
than ever.</p>

<p>In the first place, the English Reformation has been, and
still is, calumniated by writers of different parties, who look
upon it as nothing more than an external political transformation,
and who thus ignore its spiritual nature. History has
taught the author that it was essentially a religious transformation,
and that we must seek for it in men of faith, and not, as
is usually done, solely in the caprices of the prince, the ambition
of the nobility, and the servility of the prelates. A faithful
recital of this great renovation will perhaps show us that beyond
and without the measures of Henry VIII there was something&mdash;everything,
so to speak&mdash;for therein was the essence of the
Reformation, that which makes it a divine and imperishable
work.</p>

<p>A second motive forced the author to acknowledge the necessity
of a true History of the English Reformation. An active
party in the Episcopalian Church is reviving with zeal, perseverance,
and talent, the principles of Roman-catholicism, and
striving to impose them on the Reformed Church of England,
and incessantly attacking the foundations of evangelical Christianity.
A number of young men in the universities, seduced
by that deceitful <i>mirage</i> which some of their teachers have
placed before their eyes, are launching out into clerical and
superstitious theories, and running the risk of falling, sooner or
later, as so many have done already, into the ever-yawning gulf
of Popery. We must therefore call to mind the reforming
principles which were proclaimed from the very commencement
of this great transformation.</p>

<p>The new position which the Romish court is taking in England,
and its insolent aggressions, are a third consideration
which seems to demonstrate to us the present importance of this
history. It is good to call to mind that the primitive Christianity
of Great Britain perseveringly repelled the invasion of
the popedom, and that after the definitive victory of this foreign
power, the noblest voices among kings, lords, priests, and people,
boldly protested against it. It is good to show that, while the
word of God recovered its inalienable rights in Britain in the
sixteenth century, the popedom, agitated by wholly political
interests, broke of itself the chain with which it had so long
bound England.&mdash;We shall see in this volume the English government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
fortifying itself, for instance under Edward III, against
the invasions of Rome. It has been pretended in our days, and
by others besides ultra-montanists, that the papacy is a purely
spiritual power, and ought to be opposed by spiritual arms only.
If the first part of this argument were true, no one would be
readier than ourselves to adopt the conclusion. God forbid
that any protestant state should ever refuse the completest
liberty to the Roman-catholic doctrines. We certainly wish
for reciprocity; we desire that ultra-montanism should no longer
throw into prison the humble believers who seek consolation for
themselves, and for their friends, in Holy Scripture. But
though a deplorable fanaticism should still continue to imitate
in the nineteenth century the mournful tragedies of the Middle
Ages, we should persist in demanding the fullest liberty, not
only of conscience, but of worship, for Roman-catholics in protestant
states. We should ask it in the name of justice, whose
immutable laws the injustice of our adversaries can never make
us forget; we should ask it on behalf of the final triumph of
truth; for if our demands proved unavailing, perhaps with God's
help it might be otherwise with our example. When two
worlds meet face to face, in one of which light abounds, and in
the other darkness, it is the darkness that should disappear
before the light, and not the light fly from before the darkness.
We might go even farther than this: far from constraining the
English catholics in anything, we would rather desire to help
them to be freer than they are, and to aid them in recovering
the rights of which the Roman bishops robbed them in times
posterior to the establishment of the papacy; for instance, the
election of bishops and pastors, which belongs to the clergy and
the people. Indeed, Cyprian, writing to a bishop of Rome
(Cornelius), demanded three elements to secure the legitimacy
of episcopal election: "The call of God, the voice of the people,
and the consent of the co-bishops."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And the council of Rome,
in 1080, said: "Let the clergy and the <i>people</i>, with the consent
of the apostolic see or of their <i>metropolitan</i>, elect their
bishop."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In our days,&mdash;days distinguished by great liberty,&mdash;shall
the church be less free than it was in the Middle Ages?</p>

<p>But if we do not fear to claim for Roman-catholics the rights
of the church of the first ages, and a greater liberty than what
they now possess, even in the very seat of the popedom, are we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
therefore to say that the state, whether under Edward III or in
later times, should oppose no barrier against Romish aggressions?
If it is the very life and soul of popery to pass beyond the
boundaries of religion, and enter into the domain of policy, why
should it be thought strange for the state to defend itself, when
attacked upon its own ground? Can the state have no need of
precautions against a power which has pretended to be paramount
over England, which gave its crown to a French monarch,
which obtained an oath of vassalage from an English king,
and which lays down as its first dogma its infallibility and
immutability?</p>

<p>And it was not only under Edward III and throughout the
Middle Ages that Rome encroached on royalty; it has happened
in modern times also. M. Mignet has recently brought to light
some remarkable facts. On the 28th of June 1570, a letter from
Saint Pius V was presented to the catholic king Philip II
by an agent just arrived from Rome. "Our dear son, Robert
Ridolfi," says the writer, "will explain (God willing) to your
majesty certain matters which concern not a little the honour
of Almighty God.... We conjure your majesty to take into
your serious consideration the matter which he will lay before
you, and to furnish him with all the means your majesty may
judge most proper for its execution." The pope's "dear son,"
accordingly, explained to the duke of Feria, who was commissioned
by Philip to receive his communication, "that it was
proposed to kill Queen Elizabeth; that the attempt would not
be made in London, because it was the seat of heresy, but during
one of her journeys; and that a certain James G&mdash;&mdash; would
undertake it." The same day the council met and deliberated
on Elizabeth's assassination. Philip declared his willingness to
undertake the foul deed recommended by his holiness; but as it
would be an expensive business, his minister hinted to the
nuncio that the pope ought to furnish the money. This horrible
but instructive recital will be found with all its details in the
<i>Histoire de Marie Stuart</i>, by M. Mignet, vol. ii, p. 159, etc.
It is true that these things took place in the sixteenth century;
but the Romish church has canonized the priestly murderer,&mdash;an
honour conferred on a very small number of popes,&mdash;and
the canonization took place in the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This is
no very distant date.</p>

<p>And these theories, so calculated to trouble nations, are still
to be met with in the nineteenth century. At this very moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
there are writers asserting principles under cover of which the
pope may interfere in affairs of state. The kings of Europe,
terrified by the deplorable outbreaks of 1848, appear almost
everywhere ready to support the court of Rome by arms; and
ultra-montanism is taking advantage of this to proclaim once
more, "that the popedom is above the monarchy; that it is the
duty of the inferior (the king) to obey the superior; that it is
the duty of the superior (the pope) to depose the sovereigns who
abuse their power, and to condemn the subjects who resist it;
and, finally, that this public law of Christian Europe, abolished
by the ambition of sovereigns or the insubordination of peoples,
should be revived." Such are the theories now professed not
only by priests but by influential laymen.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To this opinion belong,
at the present hour, all the zeal and enthusiasm of Romanism,
and this alone we are bound to acknowledge is consistent
with the principles of popery. And accordingly it is to be feared
that this party will triumph, unless we oppose it with the united
forces of the human understanding, of religious and political
liberty, and above all of the word of God. The most distinguished
organ of public opinion in France, alarmed by the progress of
these ultramontane doctrines, said not long ago of this party:
"In its eyes there exists but one real authority in the world,
that of the pope. All questions, not only religious but moral
and political, are amenable to one tribunal, supreme and infallible,
the pope's. The pope has the right to absolve subjects of
their oath of fidelity; subjects have the right to take up arms
against their prince when he rebels against the decisions of the
holy see. This is the social and political theory of the Middle
Ages."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Since the popedom asserts claims both spiritual and temporal,
the church and the state ought to resist it, each in his own
sphere, and with its peculiar arms: the church (by which I mean
the believers), solely with Holy Scripture; the state with such
institutions as are calculated to secure its independence. What!
the church is bound to defend what belongs to the church, and
the state is not to defend what belongs to the state? If a band
of robbers should endeavour to plunder two houses, would it be
just and charitable for one neighbour to say to the other, "I
must defend my house, but you must let yours be stripped?" If
the pope desires to have the immaculate conception of the Virgin,
or any other religious doctrine, preached, let the fullest liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be granted him, and let him build as many churches as he pleases
for that purpose: we claim this in the plainest language. But
if the pope, like Saint Pius, desires to kill the queen of England,
or at least (for no pope in our days, were he even Saint enough
to be canonized, would conceive such an idea), if the pope desires
to infringe in any way on the rights of the state, then let the
state resist him with tried wisdom and unshaken firmness. Let
us beware of an ultra-spiritualism which forgets the lessons of
history, and overlooks the rights of kings and peoples. When
it is found among theologians, it is an error; in statesmen, it is
a danger.</p>

<p>Finally, and this consideration revives our hopes, there is a
fourth motive which gives at this time a particular importance
to the history we are about to relate. The Reformation is now
entering upon a new phasis. The movement of the sixteenth
century had died away during the seventeenth and eighteenth,
and it was often to churches which had lost every spark of life
that the historian had then to recount the narrative of this
great revival. This is the case no longer. After three centuries,
a new and a greater movement is succeeding that which we
describe in these volumes. The principles of the religious
regeneration, which God accomplished three hundred years
ago, are now carried to the end of the world with the greatest
energy. The task of the sixteenth century lives again in
the nineteenth, but more emancipated from the temporal power,
more spiritual, more general; and it is the Anglo-Saxon race
that God chiefly employs for the accomplishment of this universal
work. The English Reformation acquires therefore, in
our days, a special importance. If the Reformation of Germany
was the foundation of the building, that of England was its crowning
stone.</p>

<p>The work begun in the age of the apostles, and renewed in
the times of the reformers, should be resumed in our days with
a holy enthusiasm; and the work is very simple and very beautiful,
for it consists in establishing the throne of Jesus Christ in
the church and on earth.</p>

<p>Evangelical faith does not place on the throne of the church
either human reason or religious conscientiousness, as some
would have it; but it sets thereon Jesus Christ, who is both the
knowledge taught and the doctor who teaches it; who explains
his word by the word, and by the light of his Holy Spirit; who
by it bears witness to the truth, that is to say, to his redemption,
and teaches the essential laws which should regulate the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
life of his disciples. Evangelical faith appeals to the understanding,
to the heart, and to the will of every Christian, only to impose
on them the duty to submit to the divine authority of
Christ, to listen, believe, love, comprehend, and act, as God
requires.</p>

<p>Evangelical faith does not place on the throne of the church
the civil power, or the secular magistrate; but it sets thereon
Jesus Christ, who has said, <i>I am King</i>; who imparts to his subjects
the principle of life; who establishes his kingdom here on
earth, and preserves and develops it; and who, directing all
mortal events, is now making the progressive conquest of the
world, until he shall exercise in person his divine authority in
the kingdom of his glory.</p>

<p>Finally, evangelical faith does not place on the throne of the
church priests, councils, doctors, or their traditions,&mdash;or that
vice-God (<i>veri Dei vicem gerit in terris</i>, as the Romish gloss has
it), that <i>infallible</i> pontiff, who, reviving the errors of the pagans,
ascribes salvation to the forms of worship and to the meritorious
works of men. It sets thereon Jesus Christ, the great high-priest
of his people, the God-man, who, by an act of his free
love, bore in our stead, in his atoning sacrifice, the penalty of
sin;&mdash;who has taken away the curse from our heads, and thus
become the creator of a new race.</p>

<p>Such is the essential work of that Christianity which the
apostolic age transmitted to the reformers, and which it now
transmits to the Christians of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>While the thoughts of great numbers are led astray in the
midst of ceremonies, priests, human lucubrations, pontifical fables,
and philosophic reveries, and are driven to and fro in the dust
of this world, evangelical faith rises even to heaven, and falls
prostrate before Him who sitteth on the throne.</p>

<p>The Reformation is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Lord, to whom shall we go, if not unto thee?" Let others
follow the devices of their imaginations, or prostrate themselves
before traditional superstitions, or kiss the feet of a sinful man....
O, King of glory, we desire but Thee alone!</p>

<p>Those heavenly powers which had lain dormant in the
Church since the first ages of Christianity, awoke from their
slumber in the sixteenth century, and this awakening called the
modern times into existence. The Church was created anew,
and from that regeneration have flowed the great developments
of literature and science, of morality, liberty, and industry,
which at present characterize the nations of Christendom. None
of these things would have existed without the Reformation.
Whenever society enters upon a new era, it requires the baptism
of faith. In the sixteenth century God gave to man this consecration
from on high by leading him back from mere outward
profession and the mechanism of works to an inward and lively
faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNITY AND DIVERSITY.</div>

<p>This transformation was not effected without struggles&mdash;struggles
which presented at first a remarkable unity. On the
day of battle one and the same feeling animated every bosom:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
after the victory they became divided. Unity of faith indeed
remained, but the difference of nationalities brought into the
Church a diversity of forms. Of this we are about to witness a
striking example. The Reformation, which had begun its
triumphal march in Germany, Switzerland, France, and several
other parts of the continent, was destined to receive new strength
by the conversion of a celebrated country, long known as the
<i>Isle of Saints</i>. This island was to add its banner to the trophy
of Protestantism, but that banner preserved its distinctive colours.
When England became reformed, a puissant individualism joined
its might to the great unity.</p>

<p>If we search for the characteristics of the British Reformation,
we shall find that, beyond any other, they were social,
national, and truly human. There is no people among whom
the Reformation has produced to the same degree that morality
and order, that liberty, public spirit, and activity, which are the
very essence of a nation's greatness. Just as the papacy has
degraded the Spanish peninsula, has the Gospel exalted the
British islands. Hence the study upon which we are entering
possesses an interest peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>In order that this study may be useful, it should have a character
of universality. To confine the history of a people within the
space of a few years, or even of a century, would deprive that
history of both truth and life. We might indeed have traditions,
chronicles, and legends, but there would be no history. History
is a wonderful organization, no part of which can be retrenched.
To understand the present, we must know the past. Society,
like man himself, has its infancy, youth, maturity, and old age.
Ancient or Pagan society, which had spent its infancy in the
East in the midst of the antihellenic races, had its youth in the
animated epoch of the Greeks, its manhood in the stern period
of Roman greatness, and its old age under the decline of the
empire. Modern society has passed through analogous stages:
at the time of the Reformation it attained that of the full-grown
man. We shall now proceed to trace the destinies of the Church
in England, from the earliest times of Christianity. These long
and distant preparations are one of the distinctive characteristics
of its reformation.</p>

<p>Before the sixteenth century this Church had passed through
two great phases.</p>

<p>The first was that of its formation&mdash;the second that of its
corruption.</p>

<p>In its formation it was oriento-apostolical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>In its corruption it was successively national-papistical and
royal-papistical.</p>

<p>After these two degrees of decline came the last and great
phasis of the Reformation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">GOSPEL CARRIED TO BRITAIN.</div>

<p>In the second century of the Christian era vessels were
frequently sailing to the savage shores of Britain from the ports
of Asia Minor, Greece, Alexandria, or the Greek colonies in
Gaul. Among the merchants busied in calculating the profits
they could make upon the produce of the East with which their
ships were laden, would occasionally be found a few pious men
from the banks of the Meander or the Hermus, conversing
peacefully with one another about the birth, life, death, and
resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and rejoicing at the prospect
of saving by these glad tidings the pagans towards whom they
were steering. It would appear that some British prisoners of
war, having learnt to know Christ during their captivity, bore
also to their fellow-countrymen the knowledge of this Saviour.
It may be, too, that some Christian soldiers, the Corneliuses of
those imperial armies whose advanced posts reached the southern
parts of Scotland, desirous of more lasting conquests, may have
read to the people whom they had subdued, the writings of
Matthew, John, and Paul. It is of little consequence to know
whether one of these first converts was, according to tradition,
a prince named Lucius. It is certain that the tidings of the
Son of man, crucified and raised again, under Tiberius, spread
through these islands more rapidly than the dominion of the
emperors, and that before the end of the second century many
churches worshipped Christ beyond the walls of Adrian; in those
mountains, forests, and western isles, which for centuries past
the Druids had filled with their mysteries and their sacrifices,
and on which even the Roman eagles had never stooped.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These
churches were formed after the eastern type: the Britons would
have refused to receive the type of that Rome whose yoke they
detested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CULDEES.</div>

<p>The first thing which the British Christians received from
the capital of the empire was persecution. But Diocletian, by
striking the disciples of Jesus Christ in Britain only increased
their number.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Many Christians from the southern part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
island took refuge in Scotland, where they raised their humble
roofs, and under the name of <i>Culdees</i> prayed for the salvation
of their protectors. When the surrounding pagans saw the
holiness of these men of God, they abandoned in great numbers
their sacred oaks, their mysterious caverns, and their blood-stained
altars, and obeyed the gentle voice of the Gospel. After
the death of these pious refugees, their cells were transformed
into houses of prayer.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In 305, Constantius Chlorus succeeded
to the throne of the Cæsars, and put an end to the persecution.</p>

<p>The Christianity which was brought to these people by merchants,
soldiers, or missionaries, although not the ecclesiastical
catholicism already creeping into life in the Roman empire, was
not the primitive evangelism of the apostles. The East and the
South could only give to the North of what they possessed. The
mere human period had succeeded to the creative and miraculous
period of the church. After the extraordinary manifestations
of the Holy Ghost, which had produced the apostolic age,
the church had been left to the inward power of the word and
of the Comforter. But Christians did not generally comprehend
the spiritual life to which they were called. God had been
pleased to give them a divine religion; and this they gradually
assimilated more and more to the religions of human origin.
Instead of saying, in the spirit of the gospel, the word of God
first, and through it the doctrine and the life&mdash;the doctrine and
the life, and through them the forms; they said, forms first, and
salvation by these forms. They ascribed to bishops a power
which belongs only to Holy Scripture. Instead of ministers of
the word, they desired to have priests; instead of an inward
sacrifice, a sacrifice offered on the altar; and costly temples instead
of a living church. They began to seek in men, in ceremonies,
and in holy places, what they could find only in the
Word and in the lively faith of the children of God. In this
manner evangelical religion gave place to catholicism, and by
gradual degeneration in after-years catholicism gave birth to
popery.</p>

<p>This grievous transformation took place more particularly in
the East, in Africa, and in Italy. Britain was at first comparatively
exempt. At the very time that the savage Picts and
Scots, rushing from their heathen homes, were devastating the
country, spreading terror on all sides, and reducing the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to slavery, we discover here and there some humble Christian
receiving salvation not by a clerical sacramentalism, but by the
work of the Holy Ghost in the heart. At the end of the fourth
century we meet with an illustrious example of such conversions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUCCAT.</div>

<p>On the picturesque banks of the Clyde, not far from Glasgow,
in the Christian village of Bonavern, now Kilpatrick, a little
boy, of tender heart, lively temperament, and indefatigable
activity, passed the earlier days of his life. He was born about
the year 372 <small>A.D.</small>, of a British family, and was named Succat.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
His father, Calpurnius, deacon of the church of Bonavern, a
simple-hearted pious man, and his mother, Conchessa, sister to
the celebrated Martin, archbishop of Tours,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and a woman
superior to the majority of her sex, had endeavoured to instil
into his heart the doctrines of Christianity; but Succat did not
understand them. He was fond of pleasure, and delighted to
be the leader of his youthful companions. In the midst of his
frivolities, he committed a serious fault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELICAL FAITH.</div>

<p>His parents having then quitted Scotland and settled in
Armorica (Bretagne,) a terrible calamity befell them. One day
as Succat was playing near the seashore with two of his sisters,
some Irish pirates, commanded by O'Neal, carried them all
three off to their boats, and sold them in Ireland to the petty
chieftain of some pagan clan. Succat was sent into the fields
to keep swine.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was while alone in these solitary pastures,
without priest and without temple, that the young slave called
to mind the Divine lessons which his pious mother had so often
read to him. The fault which he had committed pressed
heavily night and day upon his soul: he groaned in heart, and
wept. He turned repenting towards that meek Saviour of whom
Conchessa had so often spoken; he fell at His knees in that
heathen land; and imagined he felt the arms of a father uplifting
the prodigal son. Succat was then born from on high,
but by an agent so spiritual, so internal, that he knew not
"Whence it cometh or whither it goeth." The Gospel was
written with the finger of God on the tablets of his heart. "I
was sixteen years old," said he, "and knew not the true God;
but in that strange land the Lord opened my unbelieving eyes,
and, although late, I called my sins to mind, and was converted
with my whole heart to the Lord my God, who regarded my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
low estate, had pity on my youth and ignorance, and consoled
me as a father consoles his children."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Such words as these from the lips of a swineherd in the
green pastures of Ireland set clearly before us the Christianity
which in the fourth and fifth centuries converted many souls in
the British isles. In after-years, Rome established the dominion
of the priest and salvation by forms, independently of the
dispositions of the heart; but the primitive religion of these
celebrated islands was that living Christianity whose substance
is the grace of Jesus Christ, and whose power is the grace of
the Holy Ghost. The herdsman from the banks of the Clyde
was then undergoing those experiences which so many evangelical
Christians in those countries have subsequently undergone.
"The love of God increased more and more in me," said he,
"with faith and the fear of His name. The Spirit urged me to
such a degree that I poured forth as many as a hundred prayers
in one day. And even during the night, in the forests and on
the mountains where I kept my flock, the rain, and snow, and
frost, and sufferings which I endured, excited me to seek after
God. At that time, I felt not the indifference which now I
feel: the Spirit fermented in my heart."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Evangelical faith
even then existed in the British islands in the person of this
slave, and of some few Christians born again, like him, from on
high.</p>

<p>Twice a captive, and twice rescued, Succat, after returning
to his family, felt an irresistible appeal in his heart. It was his
duty to carry the Gospel to those Irish pagans among whom he
had found Jesus Christ. His parents and his friends endeavoured
in vain to detain him; the same ardent desire pursued
him in his dreams. During the silent watches of the night he
fancied he heard voices calling to him from the dark forests of
Erin: "Come, holy child, and walk once more among us." He
awoke in tears, his breast filled with the keenest emotion.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He
tore himself from the arms of his parents, and rushed forth&mdash;not
as heretofore with his playfellows, when he would climb the summit
of some lofty hill&mdash;but with a heart full of charity in Christ.
He departed: "It was not done of my own strength," said he;
"it was God who overcame all."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PATRICK'S MISSION.</div>

<p>Succat, afterwards known as Saint Patrick, and to whic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>h
name, as to that of St. Peter and other servants of God, many
superstitions have been attached, returned to Ireland, but without
visiting Rome, as an historian of the twelfth century has
asserted.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Ever active, prompt, and ingenious, he collected the
pagan tribes in the fields by beat of drum, and then narrated to
them in their own tongue the history of the Son of God. Erelong
his simple recitals exercised a divine power over their rude
hearts, and many souls were converted, not by external sacraments
or by the worship of images, but by the preaching of the
word of God. The son of a chieftain, whom Patrick calls Benignus,
learnt from him to proclaim the Gospel, and was destined
to succeed him. The court bard, Dubrach Mac Valubair,
no longer sang druidical hymns, but canticles addressed to Jesus
Christ. Patrick was not entirely free from the errors of the
time; perhaps he believed in pious miracles; but generally
speaking we meet with nothing but the Gospel in the earlier
days of the British Church. The time no doubt will come when
Ireland will again feel the power of the Holy Ghost, which had
once converted it by the ministrations of a Scotchman.</p>

<p>Shortly before the evangelization of Patrick in Ireland, a
Briton named Pelagius, having visited Italy, Africa, and Palestine,
began to teach a strange doctrine. Desirous of making
head against the moral indifference into which most of the
Christians in those countries had fallen, and which would appear
to have been in strong contrast with the British austerity,
he denied the doctrine of original sin, extolled free-will, and
maintained that, if man made use of all the powers of his nature,
he would attain perfection. We do not find that he
taught these opinions in his own country; but from the continent,
where he disseminated them, they soon reached Britain.
The British churches refused to receive this "perverse doctrine,"
their historian tells us, "and to blaspheme the grace of Jesus
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> They do not appear to have held the strict doctrine
of Saint Augustine: they believed indeed that man has need of
an inward change, and that this the divine power alone can
effect; but like the churches of Asia, from which they had
sprung, they seem to have conceded something to our natural
strength in the work of conversion; and Pelagius, with a good
intention it would appear, went still further. However that
may be, these churches, strangers to the controversy, were unacquainted
with all its subtleties. Two Gaulish bishops, Germanus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and Lupus, came to their aid, and those who had been
perverted returned into the way of truth.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SAXON INVASION.</div>

<p>Shortly after this, events of great importance took place in
Great Britain, and the light of faith disappeared in profound
night. In 449, Hengist and Horsa, with their Saxon followers,
being invited by the wretched inhabitants to aid them against
the cruel ravages of the Picts and Scots, soon turned their
swords against the people they had come to assist. Christianity
was driven back with the Britons into the mountains of Wales
and the wild moors of Northumberland and Cornwall. Many
British families remained in the midst of the conquerors, but
without exercising any religious influence over them. While
the conquering races, settled at Paris, Ravenna, or Toledo,
gradually laid aside their paganism and savage manners, the
barbarous customs of the Saxons prevailed unmoderated throughout
the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, and in every quarter temples
to Thor rose above the churches in which Jesus Christ had
been worshipped. Gaul and the south of Europe, which still
exhibited to the eyes of the barbarians the last vestiges of Roman
grandeur, alone had the power of inspiring some degree of
respect in the formidable Germans, and of transforming their
faith. From this period, the Greeks and Latins, and even the
converted Goths, looked at this island with unutterable dread.
The soil, said they, is covered with serpents; the air is thick
with deadly exhalations; the souls of the departed are transported
thither at midnight from the shores of Gaul. Ferrymen,
sons of Erebus and Night, admit these invisible shades
into their boats, and listen, with a shudder, to their mysterious
whisperings. England, whence light was one day to be shed
over the habitable globe, was then the trysting-place of the
dead. And yet the Christianity of the British isles was not to be
annihilated by these barbarian invasions; it possessed a strength
which rendered it capable of energetic resistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLUMBA.</div>

<p>In one of the churches formed by Succat's preaching, there
arose about two centuries after him a pious man named Columba,
son of Feidlimyd, the son of Fergus. Valuing the cross
of Christ more highly than the royal blood that flowed in his
veins, he resolved to devote himself to the King of heaven.
Shall he not repay to the country of Succat what Succat had
imparted to his? "I will go," said he; "and preach the word
of God in Scotland;"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> for the word of God and not an ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hierarchism was then the converting agency. The
grandson of Fergus communicated the zeal which animated
him to the hearts of several fellow-christians. They repaired to
the seashore, and cutting down the pliant branches of the osier,
constructed a frail bark, which they covered with the skins of
beasts. In this rude boat they embarked in the year 565, and
after being driven to and fro on the ocean, the little missionary
band reached the waters of the Hebrides. Columba landed near
the barren rocks of Mull, to the south of the basaltic caverns of
Staffa, and fixed his abode in a small island, afterwards known
as Iona or Icolmkill, "the island of Columba's cell." Some
Christian Culdees, driven out by the dissensions of the Picts and
Scots, had already found a refuge in the same retired spot. Here
the missionaries erected a chapel, whose walls, it is said, still
exist among the stately ruins of a later age.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Some authors have
placed Columba in the first rank after the apostles.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> True, we
do not find in him the faith of a Paul or a John; but he lived
as in the sight of God; he mortified the flesh, and slept on the
ground with a stone for his pillow. Amid this solemn scenery,
and among customs so rude, the form of the missionary, illumined
by a light from heaven, shone with love, and manifested
the joy and serenity of his heart.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Although subject to the
same passions as ourselves, he wrestled against his weakness,
and would not have one moment lost for the glory of God. He
prayed and read, he wrote and taught, he preached and redeemed
the time. With indefatigable activity he went from house to
house, and from kingdom to kingdom. The king of the Picts
was converted, as were also many of his people; precious manuscripts
were conveyed to Iona; a school of theology was founded
there, in which the word was studied; and many received
through faith the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. Erelong
a missionary spirit breathed over this ocean rock, so justly
named "the light of the western world."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS TEACHING.</div>

<p>The Judaical sacerdotalism which was beginning to extend in
the Christian Church found no support in Iona. They had
forms, but not to them did they look for life. It was the Holy
Ghost, Columba maintained, that made a servant of God. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the youth of Caledonia assembled around the elders on these
savage shores, or in their humble chapel, these ministers of the
Lord would say to them: "The Holy Scriptures are the only
rule of faith.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Throw aside all merit of works, and look for
salvation to the grace of God alone.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Beware of a religion
which consists of outward observances: it is better to keep your
heart pure before God than to abstain from meats.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> One alone
is your head, Jesus Christ. Bishops and presbyters are equal;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>

in subjection."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The sages of Iona knew nothing of transubstantiation or of
the withdrawal of the cup in the Lord's Supper, or of auricular
confession, or of prayers to the dead, or tapers, or incense; they
celebrated Easter on a different day from Rome;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> synodal assemblies
regulated the affairs of the church, and the papal
supremacy was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The sun of the Gospel shone upon
these wild and distant shores. In after-years, it was the privilege
of Great Britain to recover with a purer lustre the same
sun and the same Gospel.</p>

<p>Iona, governed by a simple elder,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> had become a missionary
college. It has been sometimes called a monastery, but the
dwelling of the grandson of Fergus in nowise resembled the
popish convents. When its youthful inmates desired to spread
the knowledge of Jesus Christ, they thought not of going elsewhere
in quest of episcopal ordination. Kneeling in the chapel
of Icolmkill, they were set apart by the laying on of the hands
of the elders: they were called <i>bishops</i>, but remained obedient
to the <i>elder</i> or presbyter of Iona. They even consecrated other
bishops: thus Finan laid hands upon Diuma, bishop of Middlesex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
These British Christians attached great importance to the
ministry; but not to one form in preference to another. Presbytery
and episcopacy were with them, as with the primitive
church, almost identical.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Somewhat later we find that neither
the venerable Bede, nor Lanfranc, nor Anselm&mdash;the two last
were archbishops of Canterbury&mdash;made any objection to the
ordination of British bishops by plain presbyters.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The religious
and moral element that belongs to Christianity still predominated;
the sacerdotal element, which characterizes human religions,
whether among the Brahmins or elsewhere, was beginning
to show itself, but in great Britain at least it held a very subordinate
station. Christianity was still a religion and not a
caste. They did not require of the servant of God, as a warrant
of his capacity, a long list of names succeeding one another
like the beads of a rosary; they entertained serious, noble, and
holy ideas of the ministry; its authority proceeded wholly from
Jesus Christ its head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTINENTAL MISSIONS.</div>

<p>The missionary fire, which the grandson of Fergus had kindled
in a solitary island, soon spread over Great Britain. Not in Iona
alone, but at Bangor and other places, the spirit of evangelization
burst out. A fondness for travelling had already become a
second nature in this people.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Men of God, burning with
zeal, resolved to carry the evangelical torch to the continent&mdash;to
the vast wildernesses sprinkled here and there with
barbarous and heathen tribes. They did not set forth as antagonists
of Rome, for at that epoch there was no place for such
antagonism; but Iona and Bangor, less illustrious than Rome in
the history of nations, possessed a more lively faith than the
city of the Cæsars; and that faith,&mdash;unerring sign of the presence
of Jesus Christ,&mdash;gave those whom it inspired a right to
evangelize the world, which Rome could not gainsay.</p>

<p>The missionary bishops<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of Britain accordingly set forth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
traversed the Low Countries, Gaul, Switzerland, Germany, and
even Italy.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The free church of the Scots and Britons did
more for the conversion of central Europe than the half-enslaved
church of the Romans. These missionaries were not haughty
and insolent like the priests of Italy; but supported themselves
by the work of their hands. Columbanus (whom we must not
confound with Columba),<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "feeling in his heart the burning
of the fire which the Lord had kindled upon earth,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> quitted
Bangor in 590 with twelve other missionaries, and carried the
Gospel to the Burgundians, Franks, and Swiss. He continued
to preach it amidst frequent persecutions, left his disciple Gall
in Helvetia, and retired to Robbio, where he died, honouring
Christian Rome, but placing the church of Jerusalem above it,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;exhorting
it to beware of corruption, and declaring that the
power would remain with it so long only as it retained the true
doctrine (<i>recta ratio</i>). Thus was Britain faithful in planting
the standard of Christ in the heart of Europe. We might
almost imagine this unknown people to be a new Israel, and
Icolmkill and Bangor to have inherited the virtues of Zion.</p>

<p>Yet they should have done more: they should have preached&mdash;not
only to the continental heathens, to those in the north of
Scotland and the distant Ireland, but also to the still pagan
Saxons of England. It is true that they made several attempts;
but while the Britons considered their conquerors as the enemies
of God and man, and shuddered while they pronounced
their name,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the Saxons refused to be converted by the voice of
their slaves. By neglecting this field, the Britons left room for
other workmen, and thus it was that England yielded to a foreign
power, beneath whose heavy yoke it long groaned in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREGORY THE GREAT.</div>

<p>It is matter of fact that the spiritual life had waned in Italian
catholicism; and in proportion as the heavenly spirit had become
weak, the lust of dominion had grown strong. The Roman
metropolitans and their delegates soon became impatient to
mould all Christendom to their peculiar forms.</p>

<p>About the end of the sixth century an eminent man filled
the see of Rome. Gregory was born of senatorial family, and
already on the high road to honour, when he suddenly renounced
the world, and transformed the palace of his fathers into a convent.
But his ambition had only changed its object. In his
views, the whole church should submit to the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of Rome. True, he rejected the title of universal
bishop assumed by the patriarch of Constantinople; but if he
desired not the name, he was not the less eager for the substance.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
On the borders of the West, in the island of Great
Britain, was a Christian church independent of Rome: this
must be conquered, and a favourable opportunity soon occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLICY OF GREGORY AND AUGUSTINE.</div>

<p>Before his elevation to the primacy, and while he was as yet
only the monk Gregory, he chanced one day to cross a market
in Rome where certain foreign dealers were exposing their wares
for sale. Among them he perceived some fair-haired youthful
slaves, whose noble bearing attracted his attention. On drawing
near them, he learned that the Anglo-Saxon nation to
which they belonged had refused to receive the Gospel from
the Britons. When he afterwards became bishop of Rome,
this crafty and energetic pontiff, "the last of the good and the
first of the bad," as he has been called, determined to convert
these proud conquerors, and make use of them in subduing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
British church to the papacy, as he had already made use of the
Frank monarchs to reduce the Gauls. Rome has often shown
herself more eager to bring Christians rather than idolaters to
the pope.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Was it thus with Gregory? We must leave the
question unanswered.</p>

<p>Ethelbert, king of Kent, having married a Christian princess
of Frank descent, the Roman bishop thought the conjuncture
favourable for his design, and despatched a mission under the
direction of one of his friends named Augustine, A.D. 596. At
first the missionaries recoiled from the task appointed them;
but Gregory was firm. Desirous of gaining the assistance of
the Frank kings, Theodoric and Theodebert, he affected to consider
them as the lords paramount of England, and commended
to them the conversion of <i>their subjects</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Nor was this all.
He claimed also the support of the powerful Brunchilda, grandmother
of these two kings, and equally notorious for her
treachery, her irregularities, and her crimes; and did not scruple
to extol the <i>good works</i> and <i>godly fear</i> of this modern Jezebel.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Under such auspices the Romish mission arrived in England.
The pope had made a skilful choice of his delegate. Augustine
possessed even to a greater extent than Gregory himself a mixture
of ambition and devotedness, of superstition and piety, of
cunning and zeal. He thought that faith and holiness were less
essential to the church than authority and power; and that its
prerogative was not so much to save souls as to collect all the
human race under the sceptre of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Gregory himself was
distressed at Augustine's spiritual pride, and often exhorted him
to humility.</p>



<p>Success of that kind which popery desires soon crowned the
labours of its servants. The forty-one missionaries having landed
in the isle of Thanet, in the year 597, the king of Kent consented
to receive them, but in the open air, for fear of magic.
They drew up in such a manner as to produce an effect on the
rude islanders. The procession was opened by a monk bearing
a huge cross on which the figure of Christ was represented: his
colleagues followed chanting their Latin hymns, and thus they
approached the oak appointed for the place of conference.
They inspired sufficient confidence in Ethelbert to gain permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to celebrate their worship in an old ruinous chapel at
Durovern (Canterbury), where British Christians had in former
times adored the Saviour Christ. The king and thousands of
his subjects received not long after, with certain forms, and
certain Christian doctrines, the errors of the Roman pontiffs&mdash;as
purgatory, for instance, which Gregory was advocating with
the aid of the most absurd fables.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Augustine baptized ten
thousand pagans in one day. As yet Rome had only set her
foot in Great Britain, she did not fail erelong to establish her
kingdom there.</p>

<p>We should be unwilling to undervalue the religious element
now placed before the Anglo-Saxons, and we can readily believe
that many of the missionaries sent from Italy desired to work a
Christian work. We think, too, that the Middle Ages ought
to be appreciated with more equitable sentiments than have
always been found in the persons who have written on that
period. Man's conscience lived, spoke, and groaned during the
long dominion of popery; and like a plant growing among thorns,
it often succeeded in forcing a passage through the obstacles of
traditionalism and hierarchy, to blossom in the quickening sun
of God's grace. The Christian element is even strongly marked
in some of the most eminent men of theocracy&mdash;in Anselm for
instance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITAIN SUPERIOR TO ROME.</div>

<p>Yet as it is our task to relate the history of the struggles
which took place between primitive Christianity and Roman-catholicism,
we cannot forbear pointing out the superiority of
the former in a religious light, while we acknowledge the superiority
of the latter in a political point of view. We believe
(and we shall presently have a proof of it)<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> that a visit to Iona
would have taught the Anglo-Saxons much more than their
frequent pilgrimages to the banks of the Tiber. Doubtless, as
has been remarked, these pilgrims contemplated at Rome "the
noble monuments of antiquity," but there existed at that time
in the British islands&mdash;and it has been too often overlooked&mdash;a
Christianity which, if not perfectly pure, was at least better
than that of popery. The British church, which at the beginning
of the seventh century carried faith and civilization into
Burgundy, the Vosges mountains, and Switzerland, might well
have spread them both over Britain. The influence of the arts,
whose civilizing influence we are far from depreciating, would
have come later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>But so far was the Christianity of the Britons from converting
the Saxon heptarchy, that it was, alas! the Romanism of
the heptarchy which was destined to conquer Britain. These
struggles between the Roman and British churches, which fill
all the seventh century, are of the highest importance to the
English church, for they establish clearly its primitive liberty.
They possess also great interest for the other churches of the
West, as showing in the most striking characters the usurping
acts by which the papacy eventually reduced them beneath its
yoke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIONOTH AT BANGOR.</div>

<p>Augustine, appointed archbishop not only of the Saxons, but
of the free Britons, was settled by papal ordinance, first at
London and afterwards at Canterbury. Being at the head of
a hierarchy composed of twelve bishops, he soon attempted to
bring all the Christians of Britain under the Roman jurisdiction.
At that time there existed at Bangor,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in North Wales,
a large Christian society, amounting to nearly three thousand
individuals, collected together to work with their own hands,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
to study, and to pray, and from whose bosom numerous missionaries
(Columbanus was among the number) had from time
to time gone forth. The president of this church was Dionoth,
a faithful teacher, ready to serve all men in charity, yet firmly
convinced that no one should have supremacy in the Lord's
vineyard. Although one of the most influential men in the
British church, he was somewhat timid and hesitating; he would
yield to a certain point for the love of peace; but would never
flinch from his duty. He was another apostle John, full of
mildness, and yet condemning the Diotrephes, <i>who love to have
pre-eminence among the brethren</i>. Augustine thus addressed
him: "Acknowledge the authority of the Bishop of Rome."
These are the first words of the papacy to the ancient Christians
of Britain. "We desire to love all men," meekly replied the
venerable Briton; "and what we do for you, we will do for him
also whom you call the pope. But he is not entitled to call
himself the <i>father of fathers</i>, and the only submission we can
render him is that which we owe to every Christian."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This
was not what Augustine asked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECOND ROMISH AGGRESSION.</div>

<p>He was not discouraged by this first check. Proud of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pallium which Rome had sent him, and relying on the swords
of the Anglo-Saxons, he convoked in 601 a general assembly of
British and Saxon bishops. The meeting took place in the open
air, beneath a venerable oak near Wigornia (Worcester or
Hereford), and here occurred the second Romish aggression.
Dionoth resisted with firmness the extravagant pretensions of
Augustine, who again summoned him to recognize the authority
of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Another Briton protested against the presumption
of the Romans, who ascribed to their consecration a virtue
which they refused to that of Iona or of the Asiatic churches.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
"The Britons," exclaimed a third, "cannot submit either to the
haughtiness of the Romans or the tyranny of the Saxons."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
To no purpose did the archbishop lavish his arguments, prayers,
censures, and miracles even; the Britons were firm. Some of
them who had eaten with the Saxons while they were as yet
heathens, refused to do so now that they had submitted to the
pope.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The Scotch were particularly inflexible; for one of their
number, by name Dagam, would not only take no food at the
same table with the Romans, but not even under the same roof.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Thus did Augustine fail a second time, and the independence of
Britain appeared secure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIDE OF ROME.</div>

<p>And yet the formidable power of the popes, aided by the
sword of the conquerors, alarmed the Britons. They imagined
they saw a mysterious decree once more yoking the nations of
the earth to the triumphal car of Rome, and many left Wigornia
uneasy and sad at heart. How is it possible to save a
cause, when even its defenders begin to despair? It was not
long before they were summoned to a new council. "What is
to be done?" they exclaimed with sorrowful forebodings. Popery
was not yet thoroughly known: it was hardly formed. The
half-enlightened consciences of these believers were a prey to
the most violent agitation. They asked themselves whether,
in rejecting this new power, they might not be rejecting God
himself. A pious Christian, who led a solitary life, had acquired
a great reputation in the surrounding district. Some of the
Britons visited him, and inquired whether they should resist
Augustine or follow him.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> "If he is a man of God, follow him,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
replied the hermit.&mdash;"And how shall we know that?"&mdash;"If he
is meek and humble of heart, he bears Christ's yoke; but if he
is violent and proud, he is not of God."&mdash;"What sign shall we
have of his humility?"&mdash;"If he rises from his seat when you
enter the room." Thus spoke the oracle of Britain: it would
have been better to have consulted the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>But humility is not a virtue that flourishes among Romish
pontiffs and legates: they love to remain seated while others
court and worship them. The British bishops entered the
council-hall, and the archbishop, desirous of indicating his
superiority, proudly kept his seat.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Astonished at this sight,
the Britons would hear no more of the authority of Rome. For
the third time they said No&mdash;they knew <i>no other master but
Christ</i>. Augustine, who expected to see these bishops prostrate
their churches at his feet, was surprised and indignant. He
had reckoned on the immediate submission of Britain, and the
pope had now to learn that his missionary had deceived him....
Animated by that insolent spirit which is found too
often in the ministers of the Romish church, Augustine exclaimed:
"If you will not receive brethren who bring you peace,
you shall receive enemies who will bring you war. If you will
not unite with us in showing the Saxons the way of life, you
shall receive from them the stroke of death."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Having thus
spoken, the haughty archbishop withdrew, and occupied his last
days in preparing the accomplishment of his ill-omened prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Argument had failed: now for the sword!</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASSACRE.</div>

<p>Shortly after the death of Augustine, Edelfrid, one of the
Anglo-Saxon kings, and who was still a heathen, collected a
numerous army, and advanced towards Bangor, the centre of
British Christianity. Alarm spread through those feeble
churches. They wept and prayed. The sword of Edelfrid drew
nearer. To whom can they apply, or where shall they find
help? The magnitude of the danger seemed to recall the
Britons to their pristine piety: not to men, but to the Lord
himself will they turn their thoughts. Twelve hundred and
fifty servants of the living God, calling to mind what are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
arms of Christian warfare, after preparing themselves by fasting,
met together in a retired spot to send up their prayers to God.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
A British chief, named Brocmail, moved by tender compassion,
stationed himself near them with a few soldiers; but the cruel
Edelfrid, observing from a distance this band of kneeling Christians,
demanded: "Who are these people, and what are they
doing?" On being informed, he added: "They are fighting
then against us, although unarmed;" and immediately he ordered
his soldiers to fall upon the prostrate crowd. Twelve hundred
of them were slain.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> They prayed and they died. The Saxons
forthwith proceeded to Bangor, the chief seat of Christian
learning, and razed it to the ground. Romanism was triumphant
in England. The news of these massacres filled the country
<i>with weeping and great mourning</i>; but the priests of Romish
consecration (and the venerable Bede shared their sentiments)
beheld in this cruel slaughter the accomplishment of the prophecy
of the <i>holy pontiff</i> Augustine;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and a national tradition
among the Welsh for many ages pointed to him as the instigator
of this cowardly butchery. Thus did Rome loose the
savage Pagan against the primitive church of Britain, and fastened
it all dripping with blood to her triumphal car. A great
mystery of iniquity was accomplishing.</p>

<p>But while the Saxon sword appeared to have swept every
thing from before the papacy, the ground trembled under its
feet, and seemed about to swallow it up. The hierarchical rather
than Christian conversions effected by the priests of Rome were
so unreal that a vast number of neophytes suddenly returned
to the worship of their idols. Eadbald, king of Kent, was
himself among the number of apostates. Such reversions to
paganism are not unfrequent in the history of the Romish missions.
The bishops fled into Gaul: Mellitus and Justus had
already reached the continent in safety, and Lawrence, Augustine's
successor, was about to follow them. While lying in the
church where he had desired to pass the night before leaving
England, he groaned in spirit as he saw the work founded by
Augustine perishing in his hands. He saved it by a miracle.
The next morning he presented himself before the king with
his clothes all disordered and his body covered with wounds.
"Saint Peter," he said, "appeared to me during the night and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
scourged me severely because I was about to forsake his flock."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
The <i>scourge</i> was a means of moral persuasion which Peter had
forgotten in his epistles. Did Lawrence cause these blows to
be inflicted by others&mdash;or did he inflict them himself&mdash;or is the
whole account an idle dream? We should prefer adopting the
latter hypothesis. The superstitious prince, excited at the news
of this supernatural intervention, eagerly acknowledged the
authority of the pope, the vicar of an apostle who so mercilessly
scourged those who had the misfortune to displease him. If
the dominion of Rome had then disappeared from England, it is
probable that the Britons, regaining their courage, and favoured
in other respects by the wants which would have been felt by
the Saxons, would have recovered from their defeat, and would
have imparted their free Christianity to their conquerors. But
now the Roman bishop seemed to remain master of England,
and the faith of the Britons to be crushed for ever. But it
was not so. A young man, sprung from the energetic race of
the conquerors, was about to become the champion of truth
and liberty, and almost the whole island to be freed from the
Roman yoke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OSWALD.</div>

<div class="sidenote">OSWALD'S VICTORY&mdash;CORMAN.</div>

<p>Oswald, an Anglo-Saxon prince, son of the heathen and cruel
Edelfrid, had been compelled by family reverses to take refuge
in Scotland, when very young, accompanied by his brother Oswy
and several other youthful chiefs. He had acquired the language
of the country, been instructed in the truths of Holy
Writ, converted by the grace of God, and baptized into the
Scottish church.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He loved to sit at the feet of the elders of
Iona and listen to their words. They showed him Jesus Christ
going from place to place doing good, and he desired to do so
likewise; they told him that Christ was the only head of the
church, and he promised never to acknowledge any other.
Being a single-hearted generous man, he was especially animated
with tender compassion towards the poor, and would take off
his own cloak to cover the nakedness of one of his brethren.
Often, while mingling in the quiet assemblies of the Scottish
Christians, he had desired to go as a missionary to the Anglo-Saxons.
It was not long before he conceived the bold design
of leading the people of Northumberland to the Saviour; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
being a prince as well as a Christian, he determined to begin
by reconquering the throne of his fathers. There was in this
young Englishman the love of a disciple and the courage of a
hero. At the head of an army, small indeed, but strong by
faith in Christ,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> he entered Northumberland, knelt with his
troops in prayer on the field of battle, and gained a signal victory
over a powerful enemy, 634 <small>A. D.</small>
To recover the kingdom of his ancestors was only a part of
his task. Oswald desired to give his people the benefits of the
true faith.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The Christianity taught in 625 to King Edwin
and the Northumbrians by Pendin of York had disappeared
amidst the ravages of the pagan armies. Oswald requested a
missionary from the Scots who had given him an asylum, and
they accordingly sent one of the brethren named Corman, a
pious but uncultivated and austere man. He soon returned
dispirited to Iona: "The people to whom you sent me," he told
the elders of that island, "are so obstinate that we must renounce
all idea of changing their manners." As Aidan, one of
their number, listened to this report, he said to himself: "If
thy love had been offered to this people, oh, my Saviour, many
hearts would have been touched!... I will go and make
Thee known&mdash;Thee who breaketh not the bruised reed!"
Then, turning to the missionary with a look of mild reproach,
he added: "Brother, you have been too severe towards hearers
so dull of heart. You should have given them spiritual milk
to drink until they were able to receive more solid food." All
eyes were fixed on the man who spoke so wisely. "Aidan is
worthy of the episcopate," exclaimed the brethren of Iona: and,
like Timothy, he was consecrated by the laying on of the hands
of the company of elders.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF OSWALD.</div>

<p>Oswald received Aidan as an angel from heaven, and as the
missionary was ignorant of the Saxon language, the king accompanied
him every where, standing by his side, and interpreting
his gentle discourses.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The people crowded joyfully around
Oswald, Aidan, and other missionaries from Scotland and Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
listening eagerly to the <i>Word of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The king preached
by his works still more than by his words. One day during
Easter, as he was about to take his seat at table, he was informed
that a crowd of his subjects, driven by hunger, had collected
before his palace gates. Instantly he ordered the food
prepared for himself to be carried out and distributed among
them; and taking the silver vessels which stood before him, he
broke them in pieces and commanded his servants to divide
them among the poor. He also introduced the knowledge of
the Saviour to the people of Wessex, whither he had gone to
marry the king's daughter; and after a reign of nine years, he
died at the head of his army while repelling an invasion of the
idolatrous Mercians, headed by the cruel Penda (5th August,
642 <small>A. D.</small>) As he fell he exclaimed: "Lord, have mercy on
the souls of my people!" This youthful prince has left a name
dear to the churches of Great Britain.</p>

<p>His death did not interrupt the labours of the missionaries.
Their meekness and the recollection of Oswald endeared them
to all. As soon as the villagers caught sight of one on the
high-road, they would throng round him, begging him to teach
them the <i>Word of life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The faith which the terrible Edelfrid
thought he had washed away in the blood of the worshippers of
God, was re-appearing in every direction; and Rome, which
once already in the days of Honorius had been forced to leave
Britain, might be perhaps a second time compelled to flee to
its ships from before the face of a people who asserted their
liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF OSWY.</div>

<p>Then up rose the papacy. If victory remained with the
Britons, their church, becoming entirely free, might even in
these early times head a strong opposition against the papal
monarchy. If, on the contrary, the last champions of liberty
are defeated, centuries of slavery awaited the Christian church.
We shall have to witness the struggle that took place erelong
in the very palace of the Northumbrian kings.</p>

<p>Oswald was succeeded by his brother Oswy, a prince instructed
in the free doctrine of the Britons, but whose religion was all
external. His heart overflowed with ambition, and he shrank
from no crime that might increase his power. The throne of
Deira was filled by his relative Oswin, an amiable king, much
beloved by his people. Oswy, conceiving a deadly jealousy
towards him, marched against him at the head of an army, and
Oswin, desirous of avoiding bloodshed, took shelter with a chief
whom he had loaded with favours. But the latter offered to
lead Oswy's soldiers to his hiding-place; and at dead of
night the fugitive king was basely assassinated, one only of his
servants fighting in his defence. The gentle Aidan died of sorrow
at his cruel fate.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Such was the first exploit of that monarch
who surrendered England to the papacy. Various circumstances
tended to draw Oswy nearer Rome. He looked upon the
Christian religion as a means of combining the Christian
princes against the heathen Penda, and such a religion,
in which expediency predominated, was not very unlike
popery. And further, Oswy's wife, the proud Eanfeld, was of
the Romish communion. The private chaplain of this bigoted
princess was a priest named Romanus, a man worthy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
name. He zealously maintained the rites of the Latin church,
and accordingly the festival of Easter was celebrated at court
twice in the year; for while the king, following the eastern rule,
was joyfully commemorating the resurrection of our Lord, the
queen, who adopted the Roman ritual, was keeping Palm Sunday
with fasting and humiliation.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Eanfeld and Romanus
would often converse together on the means of winning over
Northumberland to the papacy. But the first step was to increase
the number of its partizans, and the opportunity soon
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILFRID AT ROME.</div>

<p>A young Northumbrian, named Wilfrid, was one day admitted
to an audience of the queen. He was a comely man, of extensive
knowledge, keen wit, and enterprising character, of indefatigible
activity, and insatiable ambition.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In this interview he
remarked to Eanfeld: "The way which the Scotch teach us is
not perfect; I will go to Rome and learn in the very temples of
the apostles." She approved of his project, and with her assistance
and directions he set out for Italy. Alas! he was destined
at no very distant day to chain the whole British church to the
Roman see. After a short stay at Lyons, where the bishop,
delighted at his talents, would have desired to keep him, he
arrived at Rome, and immediately became on the most friendly
footing with archdeacon Boniface, the pope's favourite councillor.
He soon discovered that the priests of France and Italy
possessed more power both in ecclesiastical and secular matters
than the humble missionaries of Iona; and his thirst for honours
was inflamed at the court of the pontiffs. If he should succeed
in making England submit to the papacy, there was no dignity
to which he might not aspire. Henceforward this was his only
thought, and he had hardly returned to Northumberland before
Eanfeld eagerly summoned him to court. A fanatical queen,
from whom he might hope every thing&mdash;a king with no religious
convictions, and enslaved by political interests&mdash;a pious and
zealous prince, Alfred, the king's son, who was desirous of imitating
his noble uncle Oswald, and converting the pagans, but
who had neither the discernment nor the piety of the illustrious
disciple of Iona: such were the materials Wilfrid had to work
upon. He saw clearly that if Rome had gained her first victory
by the sword of Edelfrid, she could only expect to gain a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
by craft and management. He came to an understanding on
the subject with the queen and Romanus, and having been
placed about the person of the young prince, by adroit flattery
he soon gained over Alfred's mind. Then finding himself
secure of two members of the royal family, he turned all his
attention to Oswy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AND AT OSWY'S COURT.</div>

<p>The elders of Iona could not shut their eyes to the dangers
which threatened Northumberland. They had sent Finan to
supply Aidan's place, and this bishop, consecrated by the presbyters
of Iona, had witnessed the progress of popery at the
court; at first humble and inoffensive, and then increasing year
by year in ambition and audacity. He had openly opposed the
pontiff's agents, and his frequent contests had confirmed him
in the truth.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> He was dead, and the presbyters of the Western
Isles, seeing more clearly than ever the wants of Northumbria,
had sent thither bishop Colman, a simple-minded, but stout-hearted
man,&mdash;one determined to oppose a front of adamant to
the wiles of the seducers.</p>

<p>Yet Eanfeld, Wilfrid, and Romanus were skilfully digging
the mine that was to destroy the apostolic church of Britain.
At first Wilfrid prepared his attack by adroit insinuations; and
next declared himself openly in the king's presence. If Oswy
withdrew into his domestic circle, he there found the bigoted
Eanfeld, who zealously continued the work of the Roman missionary.
No opportunities were neglected: in the midst of the
diversions of the court, at table, and even during the chase,
discussions were perpetually raised on the controverted doctrines.
Men's minds became excited: the Romanists already
assumed the air of conquerors; and the Britons often withdrew
full of anxiety and fear. The king, placed between his wife and
his faith, and wearied by these disputes, inclined first to one
side, and then to the other, as if he would soon fall altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SYNODUS PHARENSIS.</div>

<p>The papacy had more powerful motives than ever for coveting
Northumberland. Oswy had not only usurped the throne
of Deira, but after the death of the cruel Penda, who fell in
battle in 654, he had conquered his states with the exception
of a portion governed by his son-in-law Peada, the son of Penda.
But Peada himself having fallen in a conspiracy said to have
been got up by his wife, the daughter of Oswy, the latter completed
the conquest of Mercia, and thus united the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
part of England under his sceptre. Kent alone at that time
acknowledged the jurisdiction of Rome: in every other province,
free ministers, protected by the kings of Northumberland,
preached the Gospel. This wonderfully simplified the question.
If Rome gained over Oswy, she would gain England:
if she failed, she must sooner or later leave that island altogether.</p>

<p>This was not all. The blood of Oswyn, the premature death
of Aidan, and other things besides, troubled the king's breast.
He desired to appease the Deity he had offended, and not knowing
that <i>Christ is the door</i>, as holy Scripture tells us, he sought
among men for a <i>doorkeeper</i> who would open to him the kingdom
of heaven. He was far from being the last of those kings
whom the necessity of expiating their crimes impelled towards
Romish practices. The crafty Wilfrid, keeping alive both the
hopes and fears of the prince, often spoke to him of Rome, and
of the grace to be found there. He thought that the fruit was
ripe, and that now he had only to shake the tree. "We must
have a public disputation, in which the question may be settled
once for all," said the queen and her advisers; "but Rome must
take her part in it with as much pomp as her adversaries.
Let us oppose bishop to bishop." A Saxon bishop named Agilbert,
a friend of Wilfrid's, who had won the affection of the
young prince Alfred, was invited by Eanfeld to the conference,
and he arrived in Northumberland attended by a priest named
Agathon. Alas! poor British church, the earthen vessel is about
to be dashed against the vase of iron. Britain must yield before
the invading march of Rome.</p>

<p>On the coast of Yorkshire, at the farther extremity of a
quiet bay, was situated the monastery of Strenæshalh, or Whitby,
of which Hilda, the pious daughter of king Edwin, was
abbess. She, too, was desirous of seeing a termination of the
violent disputes which had agitated the church since Wilfrid's return.
On the shores of the North Sea<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the struggle was to be
decided between Britain and Rome, between the East and the
West, or, as they said then, between Saint John and Saint Peter.
It was not a mere question about Easter, or certain rules of
discipline, but of the great doctrine of the freedom of the church
under Jesus Christ, or its enslavement under the papacy.
Rome, ever domineering, desired for the second time to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
England in its grasp, not by means of the sword, but by her
dogmas. With her usual cunning she concealed her enormous
pretensions under secondary questions, and many superficial
thinkers were deceived by this man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CEDDA.</div>

<p>The meeting took place in the convent of Whitby. The king
and his son entered first; then, on the one side, Colman, with
the bishops and elders of the Britons; and on the other bishop
Agilbert, Agathon, Wilfrid, Romanus, a deacon named James,
and several other priests of the Latin confession. Last of all
came Hilda with her attendants, among whom was an English
bishop named Cedda, one of the most active missionaries of the
age.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He had at first preached the Gospel in the midland districts,
whence he turned his footsteps towards the Anglo-Saxons
of the East, and after converting a great number of
these pagans, he had returned to Finan, and, although an Englishman,
had received Episcopal consecration from a bishop, who
had been himself ordained by the elders of Iona. Then proceeding
westwards, the indefatigable evangelist founded churches,
and appointed elders and deacons wherever he went.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> By birth
an Englishman, by ordination a Scotchman, everywhere treated
with respect and consideration, he appeared to be set apart as
mediator in this solemn conference. His intervention could not
however, retard the victory of Rome. Alas! the primitive evangelism
had gradually given way to an ecclesiasticism, coarse and
rude in one place, subtle and insinuating in another. Whenever
the priests were called upon to justify certain doctrines or ceremonies,
instead of referring solely to the word of God, that
fountain of all light, they maintained that thus St. James did
at Jerusalem, St. Mark at Alexandria, St. John at Ephesus, or
St. Peter at Rome. They gave the name of <i>apostolical canons</i>,
to rules which the apostles had never known. They even
went further than this: at Rome and in the East, ecclesiasticism
represented itself to be a law of God, and from a state of
weakness, it thus became a state of sin. Some marks of this
error were already beginning to appear in the Christianity of
the Britons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISPUTATION.</div>

<p>King Oswy was the first to speak: "As servants of one and
the same God, we hope all to enjoy the same inheritance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
heaven; why then should we not have the same rule of life here
below? Let us inquire which is the true one, and follow it."...
"Those who sent me hither as bishop," said Colman, "and
who gave me the rule which I observe, are the beloved of God.
Let us beware how we despise their teaching, for it is the teaching
of Columba, of the blessed evangelist John,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and of the
churches over which that apostle presided."</p>

<p>"As for us," boldly rejoined Wilfrid, for to him as to the
most skilful had bishop Agilbert intrusted the defence of their
cause, "our custom is that of Rome, where the holy apostles
Peter and Paul taught; we found it in Italy and Gaul, nay, it
is spread over every nation. Shall the Picts and Britons, cast
on these two islands, on the very confines of the ocean, dare to
contend against the whole world?<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> However holy your Columba
may have been, will you prefer him to the prince of the
apostles, to whom Christ said, <i>Thou art Peter, and I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</i>?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">SORROW OF THE BRITONS.</div>

<p>Wilfrid spoke with animation, and his words being skilfully
adapted to his audience, began to make them waver. He had
artfully substituted Columba for the apostle John, from whom
the British church claimed descent, and opposed to Saint Peter
a plain elder of Iona. Oswy, whose idol was power, could not
hesitate between paltry bishops and that pope of Rome who
commanded the whole world. Already imagining he saw Peter
at the gates of paradise, with the keys in his hand, he exclaimed
with emotion: "Is it true, Colman, that these words were
addressed by our Lord to Saint Peter?" "It is true." "Can
you prove that similar powers were given to your Columba?"
The bishop replied "We cannot;" but he might have told the
king: "John, whose doctrine we follow, and indeed every disciple,
has received in the same sense as St. Peter the power to
remit sins, to bind and to loose on earth and in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But
the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures was fading away in Iona,
and the unsuspecting Colman had not observed Wilfrid's stratagem
in substituting Columba for Saint John. Upon this Oswy,
delighted to yield to the continual solicitations of the queen,
and above all, to find some one who would admit him into the
kingdom of heaven, exclaimed: "Peter is the doorkeeper, I will
obey him, lest when I appear at the gate there should be no one
to open it to me."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The spectators, carried away by this royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
confession, hastened to give in their submission to the vicar of
St. Peter.</p>

<p>Thus did Rome Triumph at the Whitby conference. Oswy
forgot that the Lord had said: <i>I am he that openeth, and no man
shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It was by ascribing
to Peter the servant, what belongs to Jesus Christ the master,
that the papacy reduced Britain. Oswy stretched out his
hands, Rome riveted the chains, and the liberty which Oswald
had given his church seemed at the last gasp.</p>

<p>Colman saw with grief and consternation Oswy and his subjects
bending their knees before the foreign priests. He did
not, however, despair of the ultimate triumph of the truth.
The apostolic faith could still find shelter in the old sanctuaries of
the British church in Scotland and Ireland. Immovable in the
doctrine he had received, and resolute to uphold Christian
liberty, Colman withdrew with those who would not bend beneath
the yoke of Rome, and returned to Scotland. Thirty
Anglo-Saxons, and a great number of Britons, shook off the dust
of their feet against the tents of the Romish priests. The hatred
of popery became more intense day by day among the remainder
of the Britons. Determined to repel its erroneous dogmas
and its illegitimate dominion, they maintained their communion
with the Eastern Church, which was more ancient than that
of Rome. They shuddered as they saw the red dragon of the
Celts gradually retiring towards the western sea from before the
white dragon of the Saxons. They ascribed their misfortunes
to a horrible conspiracy planned by the iniquitous ambition of
the foreign monks, and the bards in their chants cursed the
negligent ministers who defended not the flock of the Lord
against the wolves of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But vain were the lamentations!</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPACY ORGANIZED IN BRITAIN.</div>

<p>The Romish priests, aided by the queen, lost no time. Wilfrid,
whom Oswy desired to reward for his triumph, was named
bishop of Northumberland, and he immediately visited Paris to
receive episcopal consecration in due form. He soon returned,
and proceeded with singular activity to establish the Romish
doctrine in all the churches.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Bishop of a diocese extending

he offended every one who approached him by his insolence,
and taught England how wide was the difference between the
humble ministers of Iona and a Romish priest. At the same
time Oswy, coming to an understanding with the king of Kent,
sent another priest named Wighard to Rome to learn the pope's
intentions respecting the church in England, and to receive consecration
as archbishop of Canterbury. There was no episcopal
ordination in England worthy of a priest! In the meanwhile
Oswy, with all the zeal of a new convert, ceased not to repeat
that "the Roman Church was the Catholic and apostolic
church," and thought night and day on the means of converting
his subjects, hoping thus (says a pope) to redeem his own soul.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of this news at Rome created a great sensation.
Vitalian, who then filled the episcopal chair, and was as insolent
to his bishops as he was fawning and servile to the emperor,
exclaimed with transport: "Who would not be overjoyed!<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> a
king converted to the true apostolic faith, a people that believes
at last in Christ the Almighty God!" For many long
years this people had believed in Christ, but they were now beginning
to believe in the pope, and the pope will soon make
them forget Jesus the Saviour. Vitalian wrote to Oswy, and sent
him&mdash;not copies of the Holy Scriptures (which were already becoming
scarce at Rome), but&mdash;relics of the Saints Peter, John,
Lawrence, Gregory, and Pancratius; and being in an especial manner
desirous of rewarding Queen Eanfeld, to whom with Wilfrid
belonged the glory of this work, he offered her a cross,
made, as he assured her, out of the chains of St. Peter and St.
Paul.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> "Delay not," said the pope in conclusion, "to reduce
all your island under Jesus Christ," or in other words, under the
bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>The essential thing, however, was to send an archbishop from
Rome to Britain; but Wighard was dead, and no one seemed
willing to undertake so long a journey.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP THEODORE</div>

<p>There was not much zeal in the city, of the pontiffs: and the
pope was compelled to look out for a stranger. There happened at
that time to be in Rome a man of great reputation for learning,
who had come from the east, and adopted the rites and doctrines
of the Latins in exchange for the knowledge he had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
them. He was pointed out to Vitalian as well qualified to be
the metropolitan of England. Theodore, for such was his name,
belonging by birth to the churches of Asia Minor, would be
listened to by the Britons in preference to any other, when he
solicited them to abandon their oriental customs. The Roman
pontiff, however, fearful perhaps that he might yet entertain
some leaven of his former Greek doctrines, gave him as companion,
or rather as overseer, a zealous African monk named
Adrian.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Theodore began the great crusade against British Christianity,
and endeavouring to show the sincerity of his conversion by his
zeal, he traversed all England in company with Adrian,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> every
where imposing on the people that ecclesiastical supremacy to
which Rome is indebted for her political supremacy. The
superiority of character which distinguished Saint Peter, Theodore
transformed into a superiority of office. For the jurisdiction
of Christ and his word, he substituted that of the bishop
of Rome and of his decrees. He insisted on the necessity
of ordination by bishops who, in an unbroken chain, could trace
back their authority to the apostles themselves. The British
still maintained the validity of their consecration; but the number
was small of those who understood that pretended successors
of the apostles, who sometimes carry Satan in their hearts,
are not true ministers of Christ; that the one thing needful for
the church is, that the apostles themselves (and not their successors
only) should dwell in its bosom by their word, by their
teaching, and by the Divine Comforter who shall be with it for
ever and ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCORD IN THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>The grand defection now began: the best were sometimes the
first to yield. When Theodore met Cedda, who had been consecrated
by a bishop who had himself received ordination from
the elders of Iona, he said to him: "You have not been regularly
ordained." Cedda, instead of standing up boldly for the
truth, gave way to a carnal modesty, and replied: "I never
thought myself worthy of the episcopate, and am ready to lay
it down."&mdash;"No," said Theodore, "you shall remain a bishop,
but I will consecrate you anew according to the catholic ritual."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The British minister submitted. Rome triumphant felt herself
strong enough to deny the imposition of hands of the elders of
Iona, which she had hitherto recognised. The most stedfast
believers took refuge in Scotland.</p>

<p>In this manner a church in some respects deficient, but still
a church in which the religious element held the foremost place,
was succeeded by another in which the clerical element predominated.
This was soon apparent: questions of authority
and precedence, hitherto unknown among the British Christians,
were now of daily occurrence. Wilfrid, who had fixed his
residence at York, thought that no one deserved better than he
to be primate of all England; and Theodore on his part was
irritated at the haughty tone assumed by this bishop. During
the life of Oswy, peace was maintained, for Wilfrid was his
favourite; but ere long that prince fell ill; and, terrified by the
near approach of death, he vowed that if he recovered he would
make a pilgrimage to Rome and there end his days.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> "If you
will be my guide to the city of the apostles," he said to Wilfrid,
"I will give you a large sum of money." But his vow was of
no avail: Oswy died in the spring of the year 670 <small>A.D.</small></p>

<div class="sidenote">WILFRED'S DISGRACE AND END.</div>

<p>The <i>Witan</i> set aside Prince Alfred, and raised his youngest
brother Egfrid to the throne. The new monarch, who had often
been offended by Wilfrid's insolence, denounced this haughty
prelate to the archbishop. Nothing could be more agreeable to
Theodore. He assembled a council at Hertford, before which
the chief of his converts were first summoned, and presenting to
them, not the holy scripture but the <i>canons of the Romish church</i>,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
he received their solemn oaths: such was the religion then
taught in England. But this was not all. "The diocese of
our brother Wilfrid is so extensive," said the primate, "that
there is room in it for four bishops." They were appointed
accordingly. Wilfrid indignantly appealed from the primate
and the king to the pope. "Who converted England, who, if
not I? ... and it is thus I am rewarded!"... Not allowing
himself to be checked by the difficulties of the journey, he set
out for Rome, attended by a few monks, and Pope Agathon
assembling a council (679), the Englishman presented his complaint,
and the pontiff declared the destitution to be illegal.
Wilfrid immediately returned to England, and haughtily presented
the pope's decree to the king. But Egfrid, who was not
of a disposition to tolerate these transalpine manners, far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
restoring the see, cast the prelate into prison, and did not release
him until the end of the year, and then only on condition that
he would immediately quit Northumbria.</p>

<p>Wilfrid&mdash;for we must follow even to the end of his life that
remarkable man, who exercised so great an influence over the
destinies of the English church&mdash;Wilfrid was determined to be
a bishop at any cost. The kingdom of Sussex was still pagan;
and the deposed prelate, whose indefatigable activity we cannot
but acknowledge, formed the resolution of winning a bishopric,
as other men plan the conquest of a kingdom. He arrived in
Sussex during a period of famine, and having brought with him
a number of nets, he taught the people the art of fishing, and
thus gained their affections. Their king Edilwalch had been
baptized, his subjects now followed his example, and Wilfrid was
placed at the head of the church. But he soon manifested the
disposition by which he was animated: he furnished supplies of
men and money to Ceadwalla, king of Wessex, and this cruel
chieftain made a fierce inroad into Sussex, laying it waste, and
putting to death Edilwalch, the prelate's benefactor. The
career of the turbulent bishop was not ended. King Egfrid died,
and was succeeded by his brother Alfred, whom Wilfrid had
brought up, a prince fond of learning and religion, and emulous
of the glory of his uncle Oswald. The ambitious Wilfrid hastened
to claim his see of York, by acquiescing in the partition;
it was restored to him, and he forthwith began to plunder others
to enrich himself. A council begged him to submit to the decrees
of the church of England; he refused, and having lost the
esteem of the king, his former pupil, he undertook, notwithstanding
his advanced years, a third journey to Rome. Knowing
how popes are won, he threw himself at the pontiff's feet, exclaiming
that "the suppliant bishop Wilfrid, the humble slave
of the servant of God, implored the favour of our most blessed
lord, the pope universal." The bishop could not restore his
creature to his see, and the short remainder of Wilfrid's life was
spent in the midst of the riches his cupidity had so unworthily
accumulated.</p>

<p>Yet he had accomplished the task of his life: all England was
subservient to the papacy. The names of <i>Oswy</i> and of <i>Wilfrid</i>
should be inscribed in letters of mourning in the annals of Great
Britain. Posterity has erred in permitting them to sink into
oblivion; for they were two of the most influential and energetic
men that ever flourished in England. Still this very forgetfulness
is not wanting in generosity. The grave in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
liberty of the church lay buried for nine centuries is the only
monument&mdash;a mournful one indeed&mdash;that should perpetuate
their memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADAMNAN.</div>

<p>But Scotland was still free, and to secure the definitive
triumph of Rome, it was necessary to invade that virgin soil,
over which the standard of the faith had floated for so many
years.</p>

<p>Adamnan was then at the head of the church of Iona, the
first elder of that religious house. He was virtuous and learned,
but weak and somewhat vain, and his religion had little spirituality.
To gain him was in the eyes of Rome to gain Scotland.
A singular circumstance favoured the plans of those who desired
to draw him into the papal communion. One day during a
violent tempest, a ship coming from the Holy Land, and on
board of which was a Gaulish bishop named Arculf, was wrecked
in the neighbourhood of Iona.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Arculf eagerly sought an
asylum among the pious inhabitants of that island. Adamnan
never grew tired of hearing the stranger's descriptions of Bethlehem,
Jerusalem, and Golgotha, of the sun-burnt plains over
which our Lord had wandered, and the cleft stone which still
lay before the door of the sepulchre.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The elder of Iona, who
prided himself on his learning, noted down Arculf's conversation,
and from it composed a description of the Holy Land. As soon
as his book was completed, the desire of making these wondrous
things more widely known, combined with a little vanity,
and perhaps other motives, urged him to visit the court of Northumberland,
where he presented his work to the pious King
Alfred,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> who, being fond of learning and of the Christian traditions,
caused a number of copies of it to be made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE OF IONA.</div>

<p>Nor was this all: the Romish clergy perceived the advantage
they might derive from this imprudent journey. They crowded
round the elder; they showed him all the pomp of their worship,
and said to him: "Will you and your friends, who live at the
very extremity of the world, set yourselves in opposition to the
observances of the universal church?"<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The nobles of the court
flattered the author's self-love, and invited him to their festivities,
while the king loaded him with presents. The free presbyter
of Britain became a priest of Rome, and Adamnan returned
to Iona to betray his church to his new masters. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it was all to no purpose: Iona would not give way.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> He then
went to hide his shame in Ireland, where having brought a few
individuals to the Romish uniformity, he took courage and revisited
Scotland. But that country, still inflexible, repelled him
with indignation.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>When Rome found herself unable to conquer by the priest,
she had recourse to the prince, and her eyes were turned to
Naitam, king of the Picts. "How much more glorious it would
be for you," urged the Latin priests, "to belong to the powerful
church of the universal pontiff of Rome, than to a congregation
superintended by miserable elders! The Romish church
is a monarchy, and ought to be the church of every monarch.
The Roman ceremonial accords with the pomp of royalty, and
its temples are palaces." The prince was convinced by the last
argument. He despatched messengers to Ceolfrid, the abbot
of an English convent, begging him to send him <i>architects</i> capable
of building a church <i>after the Roman pattern</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>&mdash;of stone and
not of wood. Architects, majestic porches, lofty columns, vaulted
roofs, gilded altars, have often proved the most influential of
Rome's missionaries. The builder's art, though in its earliest
and simplest days, was more powerful than the Bible. Naitam,
who, by submitting to the pope thought himself the equal
of Clovis and Clotaire, assembled the nobles of his court and
the pastors of his church, and thus addressed them: "I recommend
all the clergy of my kingdom to receive the tonsure of
Saint Peter."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Then without delay (as Bede informs us) this
important revolution was accomplished by royal authority.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
He sent agents and letters into every province, and caused all
the ministers and monks to receive the circular tonsure according
to the Roman fashion.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It was the mark that popery
stamped, not on the forehead, but on the crown. A royal proclamation
and a few clips of the scissors placed the Scotch, like
a flock of sheep, beneath the crook of the shepherd of the Tiber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EGBERT THE MONK AT IONA.</div>

<p>Iona still held out. The orders of the Pictish king, the example
of his subjects, the sight of that Italian power which was
devouring the earth, had shaken some few minds; but the
Church still resisted the innovation. Iona was the last citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of liberty in the western world, and popery was filled with anger
at that miserable band which in its remote corner refused to
bend before it. Human means appeared insufficient to conquer
this rock: something more was needed, visions and miracles for
example; and these Rome always finds when she wants them.
One day towards the end of the seventh century, an English
monk, named Egbert, arriving from Ireland, appeared before
the elders of Iona, who received him with their accustomed
hospitality. He was a man in whom enthusiastic devotion was
combined with great gentleness of heart, and he soon won upon
the minds of these simple believers. He spoke to them of an
external unity, urging that a universality manifested under different
forms was unsuited to the church of Christ. He advocated
the special form of Rome, and for the truly catholic element
which the Christians of Iona had thus far possessed, substituted a
sectarian element. He attacked the traditions of the British
church,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and lavishly distributing the rich presents confided to
him by the lords of Ireland and of England,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> he soon had
reason to acknowledge the truth of the saying of the wise man:
<i>A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
whithersoever it turneth it prospereth</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONKISH VISIONS.</div>

<p>Some pious souls, however, still held out in Iona. The enthusiast
Egbert&mdash;for such he appears to have been rather than
an impostor&mdash;had recourse to other means. He represented
himself to be a messenger from heaven: the saints themselves,
said he, have commissioned me to convert Iona; and
then he told the following history to the elders who stood round
him. "About thirty years ago I entered the monastery of
Rathmelfig in Ireland, when a terrible pestilence fell upon it,
and of all the brethren the monk Edelhun and myself were left
alone. Attacked by the plague, and fearing my last hour was
come, I rose from my bed and crept into the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> There
my whole body trembled at the recollection of my sins, and my
face was bathed with tears. 'O God,' I exclaimed, 'suffer me
not to die until I have redeemed my debt to thee by an abundance
of good works.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> I returned staggering to the infirmary,
got into bed, and fell asleep. When I awoke, I saw Edelhun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with his eyes fixed on mine. 'Brother Egbert,' said he, 'it has
been revealed to me in a vision that thou shalt receive what
thou hast asked.' On the following night Edelhun died and I
recovered.</p>

<p>"Many years passed away: my repentance and my vigils did
not satisfy me, and wishing to pay my debt, I resolved to go
with a company of monks and preach the blessings of the gospel
to the heathens of Germany. But during the night a blessed
saint from heaven appeared to one of the brethren and said:
'Tell Egbert that he must go to the monasteries of Columba,
for their ploughs do not plough straight, and he must put them
into the right furrow.'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> I forbade this brother to speak of his
vision, and went on board a ship bound for Germany. We
were waiting for a favourable wind, when, of a sudden, in the
middle of the night, a frightful tempest burst upon the vessel,
and drove us on the shoals. 'For my sake this tempest is upon
us,' I exclaimed in terror; 'God speaks to me as He did to
Jonah;' and I ran to take refuge in my cell. At last I determined
to obey the command which the holy man had brought
me. I left Ireland, and came among you, in order to pay my
debt by converting you. And now," continued Egbert, "make
answer to the voice of heaven, and submit to Rome."</p>

<p>A ship thrown on shore by a storm was a frequent occurrence
on those coasts, and the dream of a monk, absorbed in the plans
of his brother, was nothing very unnatural. But in those times
of darkness, everything appeared miraculous; phantoms and
apparitions had more weight than the word of God. Instead
of detecting the emptiness of these visions by the falseness of
the religion they were brought to support, the elders of Iona
listened seriously to Egbert's narrative. The primitive faith
planted on the rock of Icolmkill was now like a pine-tree tossed
by the winds: but one gust, and it would be uprooted and
blown into the sea. Egbert, perceiving the elders to be shaken,
redoubled his prayers, and even had recourse to threats. "All
the west," said he, "bends the knee to Rome: alone against all,
what can you do?" The Scotch still resisted: obscure and unknown,
the last British Christians contended in behalf of expiring
liberty. At length bewildered&mdash;they stumbled and fell.
The scissors were brought; they received the Latin tonsure<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>&mdash;they
were the pope's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FALL OF IONA.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Thus fell Scotland. Yet there still remained some sparks of
grace, and the mountains of Caledonia long concealed the hidden
fire which after many ages burst forth with such power
and might. Here and there a few independent spirits were to
be found who testified against the tyranny of Rome. In the
time of Bede they might be seen "halting in their paths," (to use
the words of the Romish historian,) refusing to join in the holidays
of the pontifical adherents, and pushing away the hands
that were eager to shave their crowns.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> But the leaders of
the state and of the church had laid down their arms. The
contest was over, after lasting more than a century. British
Christianity had in some degree prepared its own fall, by substituting
too often the form for the faith. The foreign superstition
took advantage of this weakness, and triumphed in these
islands by means of royal decrees, church ornaments, monkish
phantoms, and conventual apparitions. At the beginning of
the eighth century the British Church became the serf of Rome;
but an internal struggle was commencing, which did not cease
until the period of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The independent Christians of Scotland, who subordinated the
authority of man to that of God, were filled with sorrow as they
beheld these back-slidings: and it was this no doubt which induced
many to leave their homes and fight in the very heart of
Europe in behalf of that Christian liberty which had just expired
among themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT AND BONIFACE.</div>

<p>At the commencement of the eighth century a great idea took
possession of a pious doctor of the Scottish church named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Clement.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The <i>work of God</i> is the very essence of Christianity,
thought he, and this work must be defended against all the encroachments
of man. To human traditionalism he opposed the
sole authority of the word of God; to clerical materialism, a
church which is the assembly of the saints; and to Pelagianism,
the sovereignty of grace. He was a man of decided character
and firm faith, but without fanaticism; his heart was open to
the holiest emotions of our nature; he was a husband and a father.
He quitted Scotland and travelled among the Franks, every
where scattering the seeds of the faith. It happened unfortunately
that a man of kindred energy, Winifrid or Boniface of
Wessex, was planting the pontifical Christianity in the same
regions. This great missionary, who possessed in an essential
degree the faculty of organization, aimed at external unity above
all things, and when he had taken the oath of fidelity to Gregory
II., he had received from that pope a collection of the Roman
laws. Boniface, henceforth a docile disciple or rather a fanatical
champion of Rome, supported on the one hand by the pontiff,
and on the other by Charles Martel, had preached to the people
of Germany, among some undoubted Christian truths,&mdash;the
doctrine of tithes and of papal supremacy. The Englishman
and the Scotchman, representatives of two great systems, were
about to engage in deadly combat in the heart of Europe&mdash;in
a combat whose consequences might be incalculable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT'S SUCCESS.</div>

<p>Alarmed at the progress made by Clement's evangelical doctrines,
Boniface, archbishop of the German churches, undertook
to oppose them. At first he confronted the Scotchman with
the laws of the Roman church; but the latter denied the authority
of these ecclesiastical canons, and refuted their contents.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Boniface
then put forward the decisions of various councils; but
Clement replied that if the decisions of the councils are contrary
to holy Scripture, they have no authority over Christians.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
archbishop, astonished at such audacity, next had recourse to
the writings of the most illustrious fathers of the Latin church,
quoting Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory; but the Scotchman
told him, that instead of submitting to the word of men, he
would obey the word of God alone.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Boniface with indignation
now introduced the Catholic church which, by its priests and
bishops, all united to the pope, forms an invincible unity; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to his great surprise his opponent maintained that there only,
where the Holy Spirit dwells, can be found the spouse of Jesus
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Vainly did the archbishop express his horror; Clement
was not to be turned aside from his great idea, either by the
clamours of the followers of Rome, or by the imprudent attacks
made on the papacy by other Christian ministers. Rome had,
indeed, other adversaries. A Gallic bishop named Adalbert,
with whom Boniface affected to associate Clement, one day saw
the archbishop complacently exhibiting to the people some relics
of St. Peter which he had brought from Rome; and being desirous
of showing the ridiculous character of these Romish practices,
he distributed among the bystanders his own hair and
nails, praying them to pay these the same honours as Boniface
claimed for the relics of the papacy. Clement smiled, like many
others, at Adalbert's singular argument; but it was not with
such arms that he was wont to fight. Gifted with profound
discernment, he had remarked that the authority of man substituted
for the authority of God was the source of all the errors
of Romanism. At the same time he maintained on predestination
what the archbishop called "horrible doctrines, contrary
to the Catholic faith."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Clement's character inclines us to believe
that he was favourable to the doctrine of predestination.
A century later the pious Gottschalk was persecuted by one of
Boniface's successors for holding this very doctrine of Augustine's.
Thus then did a Scotchman, the representative of the ancient
faith of his country, withstand almost unaided in the centre of
Europe the invasion of the Romans. But he was not long
alone: the great especially, more enlightened than the common
people, thronged around him. If Clement had succeeded, a
Christian church would have been founded on the continent independent
of the papacy.</p>

<p>Boniface was confounded. He wished to do in central Europe
what his fellow-countryman Wilfrid had done in England; and
at the very moment he fancied he was advancing from triumph
to triumph, victory escaped from his hands. He turned against
this new enemy, and applying to Charles Martel's sons, Pepin
and Carloman, he obtained their consent to the assembling of
a council before which he summoned Clement to appear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT CONDEMNED.</div>

<p>The bishops, counts, and other notabilities having met at
Soissons on the 2nd March 744, Boniface accused the Scotchman
of despising the laws of Rome, the councils, and the fathers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
attacked his marriage, which he called an adulterous union, and
called in question some secondary points of doctrine. Clement
was accordingly excommunicated by Boniface, at once his adversary,
accuser, and judge, and thrown into prison, with the
approbation of the pope and the king of the Franks.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The Scotchman's cause was every where taken up; accusations
were brought against the German primate, his persecuting spirit
was severely condemned, and his exertions for the triumph of
the papacy were resisted.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Carloman yielded to this unanimous
movement. The prison doors were opened, and Clement had
hardly crossed the threshold before he began to protest boldly
against human authority in matters of faith: the word of God
is the only rule. Upon this Boniface applied to Rome for the
heretic's condemnation, and accompanied his request by a silver
cup and a garment of delicate texture.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The pope decided in
synod that if Clement did not retract his errors, he should be
delivered up to everlasting damnation, and then requested Boniface
to send him to Rome under a sure guard. We here lose
all traces of the Scotchman, but it is easy to conjecture what
must have been his fate.</p>

<p>Clement was not the only Briton who became distinguished in
this contest. Two fellow-countrymen, Sampson and Virgil,
who preached in central Europe, were in like manner persecuted
by the Church of Rome. Virgil, anticipating Galileo, dared
maintain that there were other men and another world beneath
our feet.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He was denounced by Boniface for this <i>heresy</i>, and
condemned by the pope, as were other Britons for the apostolical
simplicity of their lives. In 813, certain Scotchmen who
called themselves bishops, says a canon, having appeared before
a council of the Roman church at Châlons, were rejected by the
French prelates, because, like St. Paul, <i>they worked with their
own hands</i>. Those enlightened and faithful men were superior
to their time: Boniface and his ecclesiastical materialism were
better fitted for an age in which clerical forms were regarded as
the substance of religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUNS SCOTUS.</div>

<p>Even Great Britain, although its light was not so pure, was
not altogether plunged in darkness. The Anglo-Saxons imprinted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
on their church certain characteristics which distinguished
it from that of Rome; several books of the Bible were translated
into their tongue, and daring spirits on the one hand, with some
pious souls on the other, laboured in a direction hostile to
popery.</p>

<p>At first we see the dawning of that philosophic rationalism,
which gives out a certain degree of brightness, but which can
neither conquer error nor still less establish truth. In the ninth
century there was a learned scholar in Ireland, who afterwards
settled at the court of Charles the Bald. He was a strange
mysterious man, of profound thought, and as much raised above
the doctors of his age by the boldness of his ideas, as Charlemagne
above the princes of his day by the force of his will.
John Scot Erigena&mdash;that is, a native of Ireland and not of Ayr,
as some have supposed&mdash;was a meteor in the theological heavens.
With a great philosophic genius he combined a cheerful jesting
disposition. One day, while seated at table opposite to Charles
the Bald, the latter archly inquired of him: "What is the distance
between a <i>Scot</i> and a <i>Sot</i>?" "The width of the table,"
was his ready answer, which drew a smile from the king.
While the doctrine of Bede, Boniface, and even Alcuin was
traditional, servile, and, in one word, Romanist, that of Scot
was mystical, philosophic, free, and daring. He sought for the
truth not in the word or in the Church, but in himself:&mdash;"The
knowledge of ourselves is the true source of religious wisdom.
Every creature is a theophany&mdash;a manifestation of God; since
revelation presupposes the existence of truth, it is this truth,
which is above revelation, with which man must set himself in
immediate relation, leaving him at liberty to show afterwards
its harmony with scripture, and the other theophanies. We
must first employ reason, and then authority. Authority proceeds
from reason, and not reason from authority."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Yet this
bold thinker, when on his knees, could give way to aspirations
full of piety: "O Lord Jesus," exclaimed he, "I ask no other
happiness of Thee, but to understand, unmixed with deceitful
theories, the word that Thou hast inspired by thy Holy Spirit!
Show thyself to those who ask for Thee alone!" But while
Scot rejected on the one hand certain traditional errors, and in
particular the doctrine of transubstantiation which was creeping
into the church, he was near falling as regards God and the
world into other errors savouring of pantheism.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
rationalism of the contemporary of Charles the Bald&mdash;the
strange product of one of the obscurest periods of history (850)&mdash;was
destined after the lapse of many centuries to be taught
once more in Great Britain as a modern invention of the most
enlightened age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALFRED AND THE BIBLE.</div>

<p>While Scot was thus plumping the depths of philosophy,
others were examining their Bibles; and if thick darkness had
not spread over these first glimpses of the dawn, perhaps the
Church of Great Britain might even then have begun to labour
for the regeneration of Christendom. A youthful prince, thirsting
for intellectual enjoyments, for domestic happiness, and for
the word of God, and who sought, by frequent prayer, for deliverance
from the bondage of sin, had ascended the throne of
Wessex, in the year 871. Alfred being convinced that Christianity
alone could rightly mould a nation, assembled round him
the most learned men from all parts of Europe, and was anxious
that the English, like the Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins, should
possess the holy scripture in their own language. He is the
real patron of the biblical work,&mdash;a title far more glorious than
that of founder of the university of Oxford. After having
fought more than fifty battles by land and sea, he died while
translating the Psalms of David for his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>After this gleam of light thick darkness once more settled
upon Great Britain. Nine Anglo-Saxon kings ended their days
in monasteries; there was a seminary in Rome from which every
year fresh scholars bore to England the new forms of popery;
the celibacy of priests, that cement of the Romish hierarchy,
was established by a bull about the close of the tenth century;
convents were multiplied, considerable possessions were bestowed
on the Church, and the tax of <i>Peter's pence</i>, laid at the pontiff's
feet, proclaimed the triumph of the papal system. But a reaction
soon took place: England collected her forces for a war
against the papacy, a war at one time secular and at another
spiritual. William of Normandy, Edward III., Wickliffe, and
the Reformation, are the four ascending steps of protestantism
in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</div>

<p>A proud, enterprising, and far-sighted prince, the illegitimate
son of a peasant girl of Falaise and Robert the Devil, duke of
Normandy, began a contest with the papacy which lasted until
the Reformation. William the Conqueror, having defeated the
Saxons at Hastings in 1066 <small>A. D.</small>, took possession of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
under the benediction of the Roman pontiff. But the conquered
country was destined to conquer its master. William, who
had invaded England in the pope's name, had no sooner
touched the soil of his new kingdom, than he learned to resist
Rome, as if the ancient liberty of the British Church had revived
in him. Being firmly resolved to allow no foreign prince
or prelate to possess in his dominions a jurisdiction independent
of his own, he made preparations for a conquest far more difficult
than that of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The papacy itself
furnished him with weapons. The Roman legates prevailed on
the king to dispossess the English episcopacy in a mass, and
this was exactly what he wished. To resist the papacy, William
desired to be sure of the submission of the priests of England.
Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, was removed, and Lanfranc
of Pavia, who had been summoned from Bec in Normandy to
fill his place, was commissioned by the Conqueror to bend the
clergy to obedience. This prelate, who was regular in his life,
abundant in almsgiving, a learned disputant, a prudent politician,
and a skilful mediator, finding that he had to choose between
his master King William and his friend the pontiff Hildebrand,
gave the prince the preference. He refused to go to Rome,
notwithstanding the threats of the pope, and applied himself
resolutely to the work the king had intrusted to him. The
Saxons sometimes resisted the Normans, as the Britons had resisted
the Saxons; but the second struggle was less glorious than
the first. A synod at which the king was present having met
in the abbey of Westminster, William commanded Wulston,
bishop of Worcester, to give up his crosier to him. The old
man rose, animated with holy fervour: "O king," he said,
"from a better man than you I received it, and to him only
will I return it."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Unhappily this "better man" was not Jesus
Christ. Then approaching the tomb of Edward the Confessor,
he continued: "O my master, it was you who compelled me to
assume this office; but now behold a new king and a new primate
who promulgate new laws. Not unto them, O master, but unto
you, do I resign my crosier and the care of my flock." With
these words Wulston laid his pastoral staff on Edward's tomb.
On the sepulchre of the confessor perished the liberty of the
Anglo-Saxon hierarchy. The deprived Saxon bishops were consigned
to fortresses or shut up in convents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRUGGLE BETWEEN WILLIAM AND HILDEBRAND.</div>

<p>The Conqueror being thus assured of the obedience of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
bishops, put forward the supremacy of the sword in opposition
to that of the pope. He nominated directly to all vacant
ecclesiastical offices, filled his treasury with the riches of the
churches, required that all priests should make oath to him,
forbade them to excommunicate his officers without his consent,
not even for incest, and declared that all synodal decisions must
be countersigned by him. "I claim," said he to the archbishop
one day, raising his arms towards heaven, "I claim to hold in
this hand all the pastoral staffs in my kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Lanfranc
was astonished at this daring speech, but prudently kept silent,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
for a time at least. Episcopacy connived at the royal pretensions.</p>

<p>Will Hildebrand, the most inflexible of popes, bend before
William? The king was earnest in his desire to enslave the
Church to the State; the pope to enslave the State to the Church:
the collision of these two mighty champions threatened to be
terrible. But the haughtiest of pontiffs was seen to yield as
soon as he felt the mail-clad hand of the Conqueror, and to
shrink unresistingly before it. The pope filled all Christendom
with confusion, that he might deprive princes of the right of
investiture to ecclesiastical dignities: William would not permit
him to interfere with that question in England, and Hildebrand
submitted. The king went even farther: the pope, wishing to
enslave the clergy, deprived the priests of their lawful wives;
William got a decree passed by the counsel of Winchester in
1076 to the effect that the married priests living in castles and
towns should not be compelled to put away their wives.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> This
was too much: Hildebrand summoned Lanfranc to Rome, but
William forbade him to go. "Never did king, not even a
pagan," exclaimed Gregory, "attempt against the holy see what
this man does not fear to carry out!"<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.... To console himself,
he demanded payment of the <i>Peter's pence</i>, and an oath of
fidelity. William sent the money, but refused the homage; and
when Hildebrand saw the tribute which the king had paid, he
said bitterly: "What value can I set on money which is contributed
with so little honour!"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> William forbade his clergy
to recognise the pope, or to publish a bull without the royal
approbation, which did not prevent Hildebrand from styling him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"the pearl of princes."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> "It is true," said he to his legate,
"that the English king does not behave in certain matters so
religiously as we could desire.... Yet beware of exasperating
him.... We shall win him over to God and St.
Peter more surely by mildness and reason than by strictness or
severity."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In this manner the pope acted like the archbishop&mdash;<i>siluit</i>:
he was silent. It is for feeble governments that Rome
reserves her energies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CÆSAROPAPIA.</div>

<p>The Norman kings, desirous of strengthening their work, constructed
Gothic cathedrals in the room of wooden churches, in
which they installed their soldier-bishops, as if they were strong
fortresses. Instead of the moral power and the humble crook
of the shepherd, they gave them secular power and a staff. The
religious episcopate was succeeded by a political one. William
Rufus went even to greater lengths than his father. Taking
advantage of the schism which divided the papacy, he did without
a pope for ten years, leaving abbeys, bishoprics, and even
Canterbury vacant, and scandalously squandering their revenues.
Cæsaropapia (which transforms a king into a pope) having thus
attained its greatest excess, a sacerdotal reaction could not fail
to take place.</p>

<p>The papacy is about to rise up again in England, and royalty
to decline&mdash;two movements which are always found combined
in Great Britain.</p>

Vassal King ravages his Kingdom&mdash;Religion of the Senses and

<p>We are now entering upon a new phase of history. Romanism
is on the point of triumphing by the exertions of learned men,
energetic prelates, and princes in whom extreme imprudence was
joined with extreme servility. This is the era of the dominion
of popery, and we shall see it unscrupulously employing the despotism
by which it is characterized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANSELM.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>A malady having occasioned some degree of remorse in the
king, he consented to fill up the vacancy in the archiepiscopal
see. And now Anselm first appears in England. He was born
in an Alpine valley, at the town of Aosta in Piedmont. Imbibing
the instructions of his pious mother Ermenberga, and believing
that God's throne was placed on the summit of the gigantic
mountains he saw rising around him, the child Anselm climbed
them in his dreams, and received the bread of heaven from the
hands of the Lord. Unhappily in after-years he recognised
another throne in the church of Christ, and bowed his head before
the chair of St. Peter. This was the man whom William
II. summoned in 1093 to fill the primacy of Canterbury. Anselm,
who was then sixty years old, and engaged in teaching at
Bec, refused at first: the character of Rufus terrified him.
"The church of England," said he, "is a plough that ought to
be drawn by two oxen of equal strength. How can you yoke
together an old and timid sheep like me and that wild bull?"
At length he accepted, and concealing a mind of great power
under an appearance of humility, he had hardly arrived in
England before he recognised Pope Urban II., demanded the
estates of his see which the treasury had seized upon, refused to
pay the king the sums he demanded, contested the right of investiture
against Henry I., forbade all ecclesiastics to take the
feudal oath, and determined that the priests should forthwith
put away their wives. Scholasticism, of which Anselm was the
first representative, freed the church from the yoke of royalty,
but only to chain it to the papal chair. The fetters were about
to be riveted by a still more energetic hand; and what this
great theologian had begun, a great worldling was to carry on.</p>

<p>At the hunting parties of Henry II. a man attracted the
attention of his sovereign by his air of frankness, agreeable
manners, witty conversation, and exuberant vivacity. This was
Thomas Becket, the son of an Anglo-Saxon and a Syrian woman.
Being both priest and soldier, he was appointed at the same
time by the king prebend of Hastings and governor of the
Tower. When nominated chancellor of England, he showed
himself no less expert than Wilfrid in misappropriating the
wealth of the minors in his charge, and of the abbeys and bishoprics,
and indulged in the most extravagant luxury. Henry, the
first of the Plantagenets, a man of undecided character, having
noticed Becket's zeal in upholding the prerogatives of the crown,
appointed him archbishop of Canterbury. "Now, sire," remarked
the primate, with a smile, "when I shall have to choose between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
God's favour and yours, remember it is yours that I shall
sacrifice."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BECKET OPPOSES THE KING.</div>

<p>Becket, who, as keeper of the seals, had been the most magnificent
of courtiers, affected as archbishop to be the most
venerable of saints. He sent back the seals to the king, assumed
the robe of a monk, wore sackcloth filled with vermin, lived on
the plainest food, every day knelt down to wash the feet of the
poor, paced the cloisters of his cathedral with tearful eyes, and
spent hours in prayer before the altar. As champion of the
priests, even in their crimes, he took under his protection one
who to the crime of seduction had added the murder of his victim's
father.</p>

<p>The judges having represented to Henry that during the first
eight years of his reign a hundred murders had been committed
by ecclesiastics, the king in 1164 summoned a council at Clarendon,
in which certain regulations or <i>constitutions</i> were drawn
up, with the object of preventing the encroachments of the
hierarchy. Becket at first refused to sign them, but at length
consented, and then withdrew into solitary retirement to mourn
over his fault. Pope Alexander III released him from his
oath; and then began a fierce and long struggle between the
king and the primate. Four knights of the court, catching up
a hasty expression of their master's, barbarously murdered the
archbishop at the foot of the altar in his own cathedral church
(<small>A. D.</small> 1170). The people looked upon Becket as a saint: immense
crowds came to pray at his tomb, at which many
<i>miracles</i> were worked.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> "Even from his grave," said Becket's
partizans, "he renders his testimony in behalf of the
papacy."</p>

<p>Henry now passed from one extreme to the other. He entered
Canterbury barefooted, and prostrated himself before the
martyr's tomb: the bishops, priests, and monks, to the number
of eighty, passed before him, each bearing a scourge, and struck
three or five blows according to their rank on the naked shoulders
of the king. In former ages, so the priestly fable ran,
Saint Peter had scourged an archbishop of Canterbury: now
Rome in sober reality scourges the back of royalty, and nothing
can henceforward check her victorious career. A Plantagenet
surrendered England to the pope, and the pope gave him authority
to subdue Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT CHARTER.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Rome, who had set her foot on the neck of a king, was destined
under one of the sons of Henry II to set it on the neck
of England. John being unwilling to acknowledge an archbishop
of Canterbury illegally nominated by Pope Innocent III,
the latter, more daring than Hildebrand, laid the kingdom
under an interdict. Upon this John ordered all the prelates
and abbots to leave England, and sent a monk to Spain as ambassador
to Mahomet-el-Nasir, offering to turn Mahometan
and to become his vassal. But as Philip Augustus was preparing
to dethrone him, John made up his mind to become a vassal
of Innocent, and not of Mahomet&mdash;which was about the same
thing to him. On the 15th May 1213, he laid his crown at
the legate's feet, declared that he surrendered his kingdom of
England to the pope, and made oath to him as to his lord paramount.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>A national protest then boldly claimed the ancient liberties
of the people. Forty-five barons armed in complete mail, and
mounted on their noble war-horses, surrounded by their knights
and servants and about two thousand soldiers, met at Brackley
during the festival of Easter in 1215, and sent a deputation to
Oxford, where the court then resided. "Here," said they to
the king, "is the charter which consecrates the liberties confirmed
by Henry II, and which you also have solemnly sworn
to observe."... "Why do they not demand my crown
also?" said the king in a furious passion, and then with an
oath,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> he added: "I will not grant them liberties which will
make me a slave." This is the usual language of weak and
absolute kings. Neither would the nation submit to be enslaved.
The barons occupied London, and on the 15th June
1215, the king signed the famous <i>Magna Charta</i> at Runnymede.
The political protestantism of the thirteenth century
would have done but little, however, for the greatness of the
nation, without the religious protestantism of the sixteenth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPERY AND LIBERTY IN COLLISION.</div>

<p>This was the first time that the papacy came into collision
with modern liberty. It shuddered in alarm, and the shock
was violent. Innocent swore (as was his custom), and then
declared the Great Charter null and void, forbade the king
under pain of anathema to respect the liberties which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
confirmed,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> ascribed the conduct of the barons to the instigation
of Satan, and ordered them to make apology to the king, and
to send a deputation to Rome to learn from the mouth of the
pope himself what should be the government of England. This
was the way in which the papacy welcomed the first manifestations
of liberty among the nations, and made known the
model system under which it claimed to govern the whole
world.</p>

<p>The priests of England supported the anathemas pronounced
by their chief. They indulged in a thousand jeers and sarcasms
against John about the charter he had accepted:&mdash;"This is the
twenty-fifth king of England&mdash;not a king, not even a kingling&mdash;but
the disgrace of kings&mdash;a king without a kingdom&mdash;the
fifth wheel of a waggon&mdash;the last of kings, and the disgrace of
his people!&mdash;I would not give a straw for him....
<i>Fuisti rex, nunc fex</i> (once a king, but now a clown)." John,
unable to support his disgrace, groaned and gnashed his teeth
and rolled his eyes, tore sticks from the hedges and gnawed
them like a maniac, or dashed them into fragments on the
ground.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The barons, unmoved alike by the insolence of the pope and
the despair of the king, replied that they would maintain the
charter. Innocent excommunicated them. "Is it the pope's
business to regulate temporal matters?" asked they. "By what
right do vile usurers and foul simoniacs domineer over our
country and excommunicate the whole world?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIGION OF THE SENSES.</div>

<p>The pope soon triumphed throughout England. His vassal
John having hired some bands of adventurers from the continent,
traversed at their head the whole country from the Channel
to the Forth. These mercenaries carried desolation in their
track: they extorted money, made prisoners, burnt the barons'
castles, laid waste their parks, and dishonoured their wives and
daughters.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The king would sleep in a house, and the next
morning set fire to it. Blood-stained assassins scoured the
country during the night, the sword in one hand and the torch
in the other, marking their progress by murder and conflagration.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Such was the enthronization of popery in England. At
this sight the barons, overcome by emotion, denounced both
the king and the pope: "Alas! poor country!" they exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"Wretched England!... And thou, O pope, a curse
light upon thee!"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The curse was not long delayed. As the king was returning
from some more than usually successful foray, and as the royal
waggons were crossing the sands of the Wash, the tide rose and
all sank in the abyss.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This accident filled John with terror: it
seemed to him that the earth was about to open and swallow
him up; he fled to a convent, where he drank copiously of cider,
and died of drunkenness and fright.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Such was the end of the pope's vassal&mdash;of his armed missionary
in Great Britain. Never had so vile a prince been the involuntary
occasion to his people of such great benefits. From
his reign England may date her enthusiasm for liberty and her
dread of popery.</p>

<p>During this time a great transformation had been accomplished.
Magnificent churches and the marvels of religious art,
with ceremonies and a multitude of prayers and chantings dazzled
the eyes, charmed the ears, and captivated the senses; but
testified also to the absence of every strong moral and Christian
disposition, and the predominance of worldliness in the church.
At the same time the adoration of images and relics, saints,
angels, and Mary the mother of God, the worships of <i>latria</i>,
<i>doulia</i>, and <i>hyperdoulia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> the real Mediator transported from
the throne of mercy to the seat of vengeance, at once indicated
and kept up among the people that ignorance of truth and absence
of grace which characterize popery. All these errors
tended to bring about a reaction: and in fact the march of the
Reformation may now be said to begin.</p>

<p>England had been brought low by the papacy: it rose up
again by resisting Rome. Grostête, Bradwardine, and Edward
III, prepared the way for Wickliffe, and Wickliffe for the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REACTION.</div>

<p>In the reign of Henry III, son of John, while the king was
conniving at the usurpations of Rome, and the pope ridiculing
the complaints of the barons, a pious and energetic man, of
comprehensive understanding, was occupied in the study of the
Holy Scriptures in their original languages, and bowing to their
sovereign authority. Robert Grostête (Greathead or <i>Capito</i>)
was born of poor parents in the county of Lincolnshire, and
being raised to the see of Lincoln in 1235, when he was sixty
years of age, he boldly undertook to reform his diocese, one of
the largest in England. Nor was this all. At the very time
when the Roman pontiff, who had hitherto been content to be
called the vicar of St. Peter, proclaimed himself the vicar of
God,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and was ordering the English bishops to find benefices for
<i>three hundred Romans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Grostête was declaring that "to follow
a pope who rebels against the will of Christ, is to separate from
Christ and his body; and if ever the time should come when all
men follow an erring pontiff, then will be the great apostasy.
Then will true Christians refuse to obey, and Rome will be the
cause of an unprecedented schism."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Thus did he predict the
Reformation. Disgusted at the avarice of the monks and priests,
he visited Rome to demand a reform. "Brother," said Innocent
IV to him with some irritation, "<i>Is thine eye evil, because I
am good?</i>" The English bishop exclaimed with a sigh: "O
money, money! how great is thy power&mdash;especially in this court
of Rome!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTEST WITH THE POPE.</div>

<p>A year had scarcely elapsed before Innocent commanded the
bishop to give a canonry in Lincoln cathedral to his infant
nephew. Grostête replied: "After the sin of Lucifer there is
none more opposed to the Gospel than that which ruins souls
by giving them a faithless minister. Bad pastors are the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of unbelief, heresy, and disorder. Those who introduce them
into the church are little better than antichrists, and their culpability
is in proportion to their dignity. Although the chief
of the angels should order me to commit such a sin, I would
refuse. My obedience forbids me to obey; and therefore I
rebel."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Thus spoke a bishop to his pontiff: his obedience to the word
of God forbade him to obey the pope. This was the principle
of the Reformation. "Who is this old driveller that in his
dotage dares to judge of my conduct?" exclaimed Innocent,
whose wrath was appeased by the intervention of certain cardinals.
Grostête on his dying bed professed still more clearly the
principles of the reformers; he declared that a heresy was "an
opinion conceived by carnal motives, <i>contrary to Scripture</i>,
openly taught and obstinately defended," thus asserting the
authority of Scripture instead of the authority of the church.
He died in peace, and the public voice proclaimed him "a
searcher of the Scriptures, an adversary of the pope, and despiser
of the Romans."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Innocent, desiring to take vengeance
on his bones, meditated the exhumation of his body, when one
night (says Matthew of Paris) the bishop appeared before him.
Drawing near the pontiff's bed, he struck him with his crosier,
and thus addressed him with terrible voice and threatening
look:<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> "Wretch! the Lord doth not permit thee to have any
power over me. Woe be to thee!" The vision disappeared,
and the pope, uttering a cry as if he had been struck by some
sharp weapon, lay senseless on his couch. Never after did he
pass a quiet night, and pursued by the phantoms of his troubled
imagination, he expired while the palace re-echoed with his
lamentable groans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION TO THE POPE.</div>

<p>Grostête was not single in his opposition to the pope. Sewal,
archbishop of York, did the same, and "the more the pope
cursed him, the more the people blessed him."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>&mdash;"Moderate
your tyranny," said the archbishop to the pontiff, "for the Lord
said to Peter, <i>Feed</i> my sheep, and not <i>shear them</i>, <i>flay them</i>, or
<i>devour them</i>."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The pope smiled and let the bishop speak,
because the king allowed the pope to act. The power of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which was constantly increasing, was soon able to give
more force to these protests.</p>

<p>The nation was indeed growing in greatness. The madness
of John, which had caused the English people to lose their continental
possessions, had given them more unity and power.
The Norman kings, being compelled to renounce entirely the
country which had been their cradle, had at length made up
their minds to look upon England as their home. The two
races, so long hostile, had melted one into the other. Free
institutions were formed; the laws were studied; and colleges
were founded. The language began to assume a regular form,
and the ships of England were already formidable at sea. For
more than a century the most brilliant victories attended the
British armies. A king of France was brought captive to London:
an English king was crowned at Paris. Even Spain and
Italy felt the valour of these proud islanders. The English
people took their station in the foremost rank. Now the character
of a nation is never raised by halves. When the mighty
ones of the earth were seen to fall before her, England could
no longer crawl at the feet of an Italian priest.</p>

<p>At no period did her laws attack the papacy with so much
energy. At the beginning of the fourteenth century an Englishman
having brought to London one of the pope's bulls&mdash;a bull
of an entirely spiritual character, it was an excommunication&mdash;was
prosecuted as a traitor to the crown, and would have been
hanged, had not the sentence, at the chancellor's intercession,
been changed to perpetual banishment.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The <i>common law</i> was
the weapon the government then opposed to the papal bulls.
Shortly afterwards, in 1307, king Edward ordered the sheriffs
to resist the arrogant pretensions of the Romish agents. But it
is to two great men in the fourteenth century equally illustrious,
the one in the state, and the other in the church, that England
is indebted for the development of the protestant element in
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRADWARDINE'S CONVERSION.</div>

<p>In 1346, an English army, 34,000 strong, met face to face
at Crecy a French army of 100,000 fighting men. Two individuals
of very different characters were in the English host.
One of them was King Edward III, a brave and ambitious
prince, who, being resolved to recover for the royal authority
all its power, and for England all her glory, had undertaken the
conquest of France. The other was his chaplain Bradwardine,
a man of so humble a character that his meekness was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
taken for stupidity. And thus it was that on his receiving the
pallium at Avignon from the hands of the pope on his elevation
to the see of Canterbury, a jester mounted on an ass rode into
the hall and petitioned the pontiff to make him <i>primate</i> instead
of that imbecile priest.</p>

<p>Bradwardine was one of the most pious men of the age, and
to his prayers his sovereign's victories were ascribed. He was
also one of the greatest geniuses of his time, and occupied the
first rank among astronomers, philosophers, and mathematicians.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
The pride of science had at first alienated him from the doctrine
of the cross. But one day while in the house of God and listening
to the reading of the Holy Scriptures, these words
struck his ear: <i>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy</i>. His ungrateful heart,
he tells us, at first rejected this humiliating doctrine with aversion.
Yet the word of God had laid its powerful hold upon
him; he was converted to the truths he had despised, and immediately
began to set forth the doctrines of eternal grace at
Merton College, Oxford. He had drunk so deep at the fountain
of Scripture that the traditions of men concerned him but
little, and he was so absorbed in adoration in spirit and in truth,
that he remarked not outward superstitions. His lectures were
eagerly listened to and circulated through all Europe. The
grace of God was their very essence, as it was of the Reformation.
With sorrow Bradwardine beheld Pelagianism every
where substituting a mere religion of externals for inward
Christianity, and on his knees he struggled for the salvation of
the church. "As in the times of old four hundred and fifty
prophets of Baal strove against a single prophet of God; so now,
O Lord," he exclaimed, "the number of those who strive with
Pelagius against thy free grace cannot be counted.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> They pretend
not to receive grace freely, but to buy it.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The will of
men (they say) should precede, and thine should follow: theirs
is the mistress, and thine the servant.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>... Alas! nearly the
whole world is walking in error in the steps of Pelagius.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Arise,
O Lord, and judge thy cause." And the Lord did arise, but
not until after the death of this pious archbishop, in the days of
Wickliffe, who, when a youth, listened to the lectures at Merton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
College, and especially in the days of Luther and of Calvin.
His contemporaries gave him the name of the <i>profound doctor</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATUTES OF PROVISORS AND PRÆMUNIRE.</div>

<p>If Bradwardine walked truthfully in the path of faith, his illustrious
patron Edward advanced triumphantly in the field of policy.
Pope Clement IV having decreed that the first two vacancies
in the Anglican church should be conferred on two of his cardinals:
"France is becoming <i>English</i>," said the courtiers to the
king; "and by way of compensation, England is becoming
<i>Italian</i>." Edward, desirous of guaranteeing the religious liberties
of England, passed with the consent of parliament in 1350
the statute of <i>provisors</i>, which made void every ecclesiastical
appointment contrary to the rights of the king, the chapters, or
the patrons. Thus the privileges of the chapters and the
liberty of the English Catholics, as well as the independence of
the crown, were protected against the invasion of foreigners; and
imprisonment or banishment for life was denounced upon all
offenders against the law.</p>

<p>This bold step alarmed the pontiff. Accordingly, three years
after, the king having nominated one of his secretaries to the
see of Durham&mdash;a man without any of the qualities becoming
a bishop&mdash;the pope readily confirmed the appointment. When
some one expressed his astonishment at this, the pope made
answer: "If the king of England had nominated <i>an ass</i>, I would
have accepted him." This may remind us of the <i>ass</i> of Avignon;
and it would seem that this humble animal at that time
played a significant part in the elections to the papacy. But be
that as it may, the pope withdrew his pretensions. "Empires
have their term," observes an historian at this place; "when
once they have reached it, they halt, they retrograde, they fall."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The term seemed to be drawing nearer every day. In the
reign of Edward III, between 1343 and 1353, again in 1364,
and finally under Richard II, in 1393, those stringent laws were
passed which interdicted all appeal to the court of Rome, all
bulls from the Roman bishop, all excommunications, etc., in a
word, every act infringing on the rights of the crown; and declared
that whoever should bring such documents into England,
or receive, publish, or execute them, should be put out of the
king's protection, deprived of their property, attached in their
persons, and brought before the king in council to undergo
their trial according to the terms of the act. Such was the
statute of <i>Præmunire</i>.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Great was the indignation of the Romans at the news of this
law: "If the statute of <i>mortmain</i> put the pope into a sweat," says
Fuller, "this of <i>præmunire</i> gave him a fit of fever." One pope
called it an "execrable statute,"&mdash;"a horrible crime."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Such are
the terms applied by the pontiffs to all that thwarts their ambition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO WARS.</div>

<p>Of the two wars carried on by Edward&mdash;the one against the
King of France, and the other against popery&mdash;the latter was
the most righteous and important. The benefits which this
prince had hoped to derive from his brilliant victories at Crecy
and Poitiers dwindled away almost entirely before his death;
while his struggles with the papacy, founded as they were on
truth, have exerted even to our own days an indisputable influence
on the destinies of Great Britain. Yet the prayers and
the conquests of Bradwardine, who proclaimed in that fallen
age the doctrine of grace, produced effects still greater, not only
for the salvation of many souls, but for the liberty, moral force,
and greatness of England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Mendicant Friars&mdash;Their Disorders and Popular Indignation&mdash;Wickliffe&mdash;His

and the Four Regents.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thus in the first half of the fourteenth century, nearly two
hundred years before the Reformation, England appeared weary
of the yoke of Rome. Bradwardine was no more; but a man
who had been his disciple was about to succeed him, and without
attaining to the highest functions, to exhibit in his person
the past and future tendencies of the church of Christ in Great
Britain. The English Reformation did not begin with Henry
VIII: the revival of the sixteenth century is but a link in the
chain commencing with the apostles and reaching to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEGGING FRIARS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>The resistance of Edward III to the papacy <i>without</i> had not
suppressed the papacy <i>within</i>. The mendicant friars, and particularly
the Franciscans, those fanatical soldiers of the pope,
were endeavouring by pious frauds to monopolize the wealth of
the country. "Every year," said they, "Saint Francis descends
from heaven to purgatory, and delivers the souls of all those
who were buried in the dress of his order." These friars used
to kidnap children from their parents and shut them up in
monasteries. They affected to be poor, and with a wallet on
their back, begged with a piteous air from both high and low;
but at the same time they dwelt in palaces, heaped up treasures,
dressed in costly garments, and wasted their time in
luxurious entertainments.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The least of them looked upon
themselves as <i>lords</i>, and those who wore the doctor's cap considered
themselves <i>kings</i>. While they diverted themselves, eating
and drinking at their well-spread tables, they used to send
ignorant uneducated persons in their place to preach fables and
legends to amuse and plunder the people.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> If any rich man
talked of giving alms to the poor and not to the monks, they
exclaimed loudly against such impiety, and declared with threatening
voices: "If you do so we will leave the country, and return
accompanied by a legion of glittering helmets."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Public
indignation was at its height. "The monks and priests of
Rome," was the cry, "are eating us away like a cancer. God
must deliver us or the people will perish.... Woe be to them!
the cup of wrath will run over. Men of holy church shall be
despised as carrion, as dogs shall they be cast out in open
places."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The arrogance of Rome made the cup run over. Pope Urban
V, heedless of the laurels won by the conqueror at Crecy and
Poitiers, summoned Edward III to recognize him as legitimate
sovereign of England, and to pay as feudal tribute the annual
rent of one thousand marcs. In case of refusal the king was to
appear before him at Rome. For thirty-three years the popes
had never mentioned the tribute accorded by John to Innocent
III, and which had always been paid very irregularly. The conqueror
of the Valois was irritated by this insolence on the part
of an Italian bishop, and called on God to avenge England.
From Oxford came forth the avenger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN WICKLIFFE.</div>

<p>John Wickliffe, born in 1324, in a little village in Yorkshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was one of the students who attended the lectures of the pious
Bradwardine at Merton College. He was in the flower of his
age, and produced a great sensation in the university. In 1348,
a terrible pestilence, which is said to have carried off half the
human race, appeared in England after successively devastating
Asia and the continent of Europe. This visitation of the Almighty
sounded like the trumpet of the judgment-day in the
heart of Wickliffe. Alarmed at the thoughts of eternity, the
young man&mdash;for he was then only twenty-four years old&mdash;passed
days and nights in his cell groaning and sighing, and calling upon
God to show him the path he ought to follow.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> He found
it in the Holy Scriptures, and resolved to make it known to
others. He commenced with prudence; but being elected in
1361 warden of Balliol, and in 1365 warden of Canterbury
College also, he began to set forth the doctrine of faith in a
more energetic manner. His biblical and philosophical studies,
his knowledge of theology, his penetrating mind, the purity of
his manners, and his unbending courage, rendered him the object
of general admiration. A profound teacher, like his master,
and an eloquent preacher, he demonstrated to the learned
during the course of the week what he intended to preach, and
on Sunday he preached to the people what he had previously
demonstrated. His disputations gave strength to his sermons,
and his sermons shed light upon his disputations. He accused
the clergy of having banished the Holy Scriptures, and required
that the authority of the word of God should be re-established
in the church. Loud acclamations crowned these discussions,
and the crowd of vulgar minds trembled with indignation when
they heard these shouts of applause.</p>

<p>Wickliffe was forty years old when the papal arrogance stirred
England to its depths. Being at once an able politician and a
fervent Christian, he vigorously defended the rights of the
crown against the Romish aggression, and by his arguments
not only enlightened his fellow-countrymen generally, but
stirred up the zeal of several members of both houses of parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LORDS AGAINST THE PAPAL TRIBUTE.</div>

<p>The parliament assembled, and never perhaps had it been
summoned on a question which excited to so high a degree the
emotions of England, and indeed of Christendom. The debates
in the House of Lords were especially remarkable: all the arguments
of Wickliffe were reproduced. "Feudal <i>tribute</i> is due,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
said one, "only to him who can grant feudal <i>protection</i> in return.
Now how can the pope wage war to protect his fiefs?"&mdash;"Is
it as vassal of the crown or as feudal superior," asked another,
"that the pope demands part of our property? Urban
V will not accept the first of these titles.... Well and good!
but the English people will not acknowledge the second."
"Why," said a third, "was this tribute originally granted? To
pay the pope for absolving John.... His demand, then, is
mere simony, a kind of clerical swindling, which the lords spiritual
and temporal should indignantly oppose."&mdash;"No," said another
speaker, "England belongs not to the pope. The pope is
but a man, subject to sin; but Christ is the Lord of lords, and
this kingdom is held directly and solely of Christ alone."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Thus
spoke the lords inspired by Wickliffe. Parliament decided unanimously
that no prince had the right to alienate the sovereignty
of the kingdom without the consent of the other two
estates, and that if the pontiff should attempt to proceed against
the king of England as his vassal, the nation should rise in a
body to maintain the independence of the crown.</p>

<p>To no purpose did this generous resolution excite the wrath
of the partisans of Rome; to no purpose did they assert that, by
the canon law, the king ought to be deprived of his fief, and,
that England now belonged to the pope: "No," replied Wickliffe,
"the canon law has no force when it is opposed to the
word of God." Edward III made Wickliffe one of his chaplains,
and the papacy has ceased from that hour to lay claim&mdash;in
explicit terms at least&mdash;to the Sovereignty of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE BEFORE THE CONVOCATION.</div>

<p>When the pope gave up his temporal he was desirous, at the
very least, of keeping up his ecclesiastical pretensions, and to
procure the repeal of the statutes of <i>Præmunire</i> and <i>Provisors</i>.
It was accordingly resolved to hold a conference at Bruges to
treat of this question, and Wickliffe, who had been created
doctor of theology two years before, proceeded thither with the
other commissioners in April 1374. They came to an arrangement
in 1375 that the king should bind himself to repeal the
penalties denounced against the pontifical agents, and that the
pope should confirm the king's ecclesiastical presentations.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
But the nation was not pleased with this compromise. "The
clerks sent from Rome," said the Commons, "are more dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for the kingdom than Jews or Saracens: every papal
agent resident in England, and every Englishman living at the
court of Rome, should be punished with death." Such was the
language of the <i>Good Parliament</i>. In the fourteenth century
the English nation called a parliament <i>good</i> which did not yield
to the papacy.</p>

<p>Wickliffe, after his return to England, was presented to the
rectory of Lutterworth, and from that time a practical activity
was added to his academic influence. At Oxford he spoke as a
master to the young theologians; in his parish he addressed the
people as a preacher and as a pastor. "The Gospel," said he,
"is the only source of religion. The Roman pontiff is a mere
cut-purse,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and, far from having the right to reprimand the
whole world, he may be lawfully reproved by his inferiors, and
even by laymen."</p>

<p>The papacy grew alarmed. Courtenay, son of the Earl of
Devonshire, an imperious but grave priest, and full of zeal for
what he believed to be the truth, had recently been appointed
to the see of London. In parliament he had resisted Wickliffe's
patron, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, third son of Edward
III., and head of the house of that name. The bishop, observing
that the doctrines of the reformer were spreading among
the people, both high and low, charged him with heresy, and
summoned him to appear before the convocation assembled in
St Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURTENAY AND LANCASTER.</div>

<p>On the 19th February, 1377, an immense crowd, heated with
fanaticism, thronged the approaches to the church and filled its
aisles, while the citizens favourable to the reform remained concealed
in their houses. Wickliffe moved forward, preceded by
Lord Percy, marshal of England, and supported by the Duke of
Lancaster, who defended him from purely political motives. He
was followed by four bachelors of divinity, his counsel, and
passed through the hostile multitude who looked upon Lancaster
as the enemy of their liberties, and upon himself as the enemy
of the church. "Let not the sight of these bishops make you
shrink a hair's-breadth in your profession of faith," said the
prince to the doctor. "They are unlearned; and as for this
concourse of people, fear nothing, we are here to defend you."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
When the reformer had crossed the threshold of the cathedral,
the crowd within appeared like a solid wall; and, notwithstanding
the efforts of the earl-marshal, Wickliffe and Lancaster could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
not advance. The people swayed to and fro, hands were raised
in violence, and loud hootings re-echoed through the building.
At length Percy made an opening in the dense multitude, and
Wickliffe passed on.</p>

<p>The haughty Courtenay, who had been commissioned by
the archbishop to preside over the assembly, watched these
strange movements with anxiety, and beheld with displeasure
the learned doctor accompanied by the two most powerful men
in England. He said nothing to the Duke of Lancaster, who at
that time administered the kingdom, but turning towards Percy
observed sharply: "If I had known, my lord, that you claimed
to be master in this church, I would have taken measures to
prevent your entrance." Lancaster coldly rejoined: "He shall
keep such mastery here, though you say nay." Percy now
turned to Wickliffe, who had remained standing and said: "Sit
down and rest yourself." At this Courtenay gave way to his
anger, and exclaimed in a loud tone: "He must not sit down;
criminals stand before their judges." Lancaster, indignant that
a learned doctor of England should be refused a favour to which
his age alone entitled him (for he was between fifty and sixty)
made answer to the bishop: "My lord, you are very arrogant;
take care ... or I may bring down your pride, and not yours
only, but that of all the prelacy in England."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>&mdash;"Do me all
the harm you can," was Courtenay's haughty reply. The
prince rejoined with some emotion: "You are insolent, my lord.
You think, no doubt, you can trust on your family ... but
your relations will have trouble enough to protect themselves."
To this the bishop nobly replied: "My confidence is not in my
parents nor in any man; but only in God, in whom I trust, and
by whose assistance I will be bold to speak the truth." Lancaster,
who saw hypocrisy only in these words, turned to one of
his attendants, and whispered in his ear, but so loud as to be
heard by the bystanders: "I would rather pluck the bishop by
the hair of his head out of his chair, than take this at his hands."
Every impartial reader must confess that the prelate spoke with
greater dignity than the prince. Lancaster had hardly uttered
these imprudent words before the bishop's partizans fell upon
him and Percy, and even upon Wickliffe, who alone had remained
calm.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The two noblemen resisted, their friends and servants
defended them, the uproar became extreme, and there was no
hope of restoring tranquillity. The two lords escaped with
difficulty, and the assembly broke up in great confusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIOT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>On the following day the earl-marshal having called upon
parliament to apprehend the disturbers of the public peace, the
clerical party uniting with the enemies of Lancaster, filled the
streets with their clamour; and while the duke and the earl
escaped by the Thames, the mob collected before Percy's house,
broke down the doors, searched every chamber, and thrust their
swords into every dark corner. When they found that he had
escaped, the rioters, imagining that he was concealed in Lancaster's
palace, rushed to the Savoy, at that time the most magnificent
building in the kingdom. They killed a priest who endeavoured
to stay them, tore down the ducal arms, and hung
them on the gallows like those of a traitor. They would have
gone still farther if the bishop had not very opportunely reminded
them that they were <i>in Lent</i>. As for Wickliffe, he was dismissed
with an injunction against preaching his doctrines.</p>

<p>But this decision of the priests was not ratified by the people
of England. Public opinion declared in favour of Wickliffe.
"If he is guilty," said they, "why is he not punished? If he
is innocent, why is he ordered to be silent? If he is the weakest
in power, he is the strongest in truth!" And so indeed he was,
and never had he spoken with such energy. He openly attacked
the pretended apostolical chair, and declared that the <i>two</i> antipopes
who sat at Rome and Avignon together made <i>one</i> antichrist.
Being now in opposition to the pope, Wickliffe was soon
to confess that Christ alone was king of the church; and that it
is not possible for a man to be excommunicated, unless first and
principally he be excommunicated by himself.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Rome could not close her ears. Wickliffe's enemies sent
thither nineteen propositions which they ascribed to him, and
in the month of June 1377, just as Richard II, son of the
Black Prince, a child eleven years old, was ascending the throne,
three letters from Gregory XI, addressed to the king, the archbishop
of Canterbury, and the university of Oxford, denounced
Wickliffe as a heretic, and called upon them to proceed against
him as against a common thief. The archbishop issued the
citation: the crown and the university were silent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE AT LAMBETH.</div>

<p>On the appointed day, Wickliffe, unaccompanied by either
Lancaster or Percy, proceeded to the archiepiscopal chapel at
Lambeth. "Men expected he should be devoured," says an
historian; "being brought into the lion's den."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> But the
burgesses had taken the prince's place. The assault of Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had aroused the friends of liberty and truth in England. "The
pope's briefs," said they, "ought to have no effect in the realm
without the king's consent. Every man is master in his own
house."</p>

<p>The archbishop had scarcely opened the sitting, when Sir
Louis Clifford entered the chapel, and forbade the court, on the
part of the queen-mother, to proceed against the reformer.
The bishops were struck with a panic-fear: "they bent their
heads," says a Roman-catholic historian, "like a reed before the
wind."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Wickliffe retired after handing in a protest. "In
the first place," said he, "I resolve with my whole heart, and
by the grace of God, to be a sincere Christian; and, while my
life shall last, to profess and defend the law of Christ so far
as I have power."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Wickliffe's enemies attacked this protest,
and one of them eagerly maintained that whatever the pope
ordered should be looked upon as right. "What!" answered the
reformer; "the pope may then exclude from the canon of the
scriptures any book that displeases him, and alter the Bible at
pleasure?" Wickliffe thought that Rome, unsettling the grounds
of infallibility, had transferred it from the Scriptures to the
pope, and was desirous of restoring it to its true place, and
re-establishing authority in the church on a truly divine
foundation.</p>

<p>A great change was now taking place in the reformer.
Busying himself less about the kingdom of England, he occupied
himself more about the kingdom of Christ. In him the political
phasis was followed by the religious. To carry the glad
tidings of the Gospel into the remotest hamlets, was now the
great idea which possessed Wickliffe. If begging friars (said he)
stroll over the country, preaching the legends of saints and the
history of the Trojan war, we must do for God's glory what they
do to fill their wallets, and form a vast itinerant evangelization
to convert souls to Jesus Christ. Turning to the most pious of
his disciples, he said to them: "Go and preach, it is the sublimest
work; but imitate not the priests whom we see after the
sermon sitting in the ale-houses, or at the gaming-table, or
wasting their time in hunting. After your sermon is ended,
do you visit the sick, the aged, the poor, the blind, and the
lame, and succour them according to your ability." Such was
the new practical theology which Wickliffe inaugurated&mdash;it was
that of Christ himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREACHING AND PERSECUTION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>The "poor priests," as they were called, set off barefoot, a
staff in their hands, clothed in a coarse robe, living on alms,
and satisfied with the plainest food. They stopped in the fields
near some village, in the churchyards, in the market-places of
the towns, and sometimes in the churches even.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The people,
among whom they were favourites, thronged around them, as
the men of Northumbria had done at Aidan's preaching. They
spoke with a popular eloquence that entirely won over those
who listened to them. Of these missionaries none was more
beloved than John Ashton. He might be seen wandering over
the country in every direction, or seated at some cottage hearth,
or alone in some retired crossway, preaching to an attentive
crowd. Missions of this kind have constantly revived in England
at the great epochs of the church.</p>

<p>The "poor priests" were not content with mere polemics:
they preached the great mystery of godliness. "An angel
could have made no propitiation for man," one day exclaimed
their master Wickliffe; "for the nature which has sinned is not
that of the angels. The mediator must needs be a man; but
every man being indebted to God for every thing that he is
able to do, this man must needs have infinite merit, and be at
the same time God."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The clergy became alarmed, and a law was passed commanding
every king's officer to commit the preachers and their followers
to prison.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In consequence of this, as soon as the humble
missionary began to preach, the monks set themselves in motion.
They watched him from the windows of their cells, at the street-corners,
or from behind a hedge, and then hastened off to procure
assistance. But when the constables approached, a body
of stout bold men stood forth, with arms in their hands, who
surrounded the preacher, and zealously protected him against
the attacks of the clergy. Carnal weapons were thus mingled
with the preachings of the word of peace. The poor priests returned
to their master: Wickliffe comforted them, advised with
them, and then they departed once more. Every day this
evangelization reached some new spot, and the light was thus
penetrating into every quarter of England, when the reformer
was suddenly stopped in his work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE'S PROPHECY.</div>

<p>Wickliffe was at Oxford in the year 1379, busied in the discharge
of his duties as professor of divinity, when he fell dangerously
ill. His was not a strong constitution; and work, age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and above all persecution had weakened him. Great was the
joy in the monasteries; but for that joy to be complete, the
<i>heretic</i> must recant. Every effort was made to bring this about
in his last moments.</p>

<p>The four regents, who represented the four religious orders,
accompanied by four aldermen, hastened to the bedside of the dying
man, hoping to frighten him by threatening him with the vengeance
of Heaven. They found him calm and serene. "You have
death on your lips," said they; "be touched by your faults, and
retract in our presence all that you have said to our injury."
Wickliffe remained silent, and the monks flattered themselves
with an easy victory. But the nearer the reformer approached
eternity, the greater was his horror of monkery. The consolation
he had found in Jesus Christ had given him fresh energy.
He begged his servant to raise him on his couch. Then feeble
and pale, and scarcely able to support himself, he turned towards
the friars, who were waiting for his recantation, and opening
his livid lips, and fixing on them a piercing look, he said with
emphasis: "I shall not die but live; and again declare the evil
deeds of the friars." We might almost picture to ourselves the
spirit of Elijah threatening the priests of Baal. The regents
and their companions looked at each other with astonishment.
They left the room in confusion, and the reformer recovered to
put the finishing touch to the most important of his works
against the monks and against the pope.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIBLE.</div>

<p>Wickliffe's ministry had followed a progressive course. At
first he had attacked the papacy; next he preached the gospel
to the poor; he could take one more step and put the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in permanent possession of the word of God. This was the
third phase of his activity.</p>

<p>Scholasticism had banished the Scriptures into a mysterious
obscurity. It is true that Bede had translated the Gospel of
St. John; that the learned men at Alfred's court had translated
the four evangelists; that Elfric in the reign of Ethelred had
translated some books of the Old Testament; that an Anglo-Norman
priest had paraphrased the Gospels and the acts; that
Richard Rolle, "the hermit of Hampole," and some pious clerks
in the fourteenth century, had produced a version of the Psalms,
the Gospels, and Epistles:&mdash;but these rare volumes were hidden,
like theological curiosities, in the libraries of a few convents.
It was then a maxim that the reading of the Bible was injurious
to the laity; and accordingly the priests forbade it, just as the
Brahmins forbid the Shasters to the Hindoos. Oral tradition
alone preserved among the people the histories of the Holy
Scriptures, mingled with legends of the saints. The time appeared
ripe for the publication of a Bible. The increase of
population, the attention the English were beginning to devote
to their own language, the development which the system of
representative government had received, the awakening of the
human mind:&mdash;all these circumstances favoured the reformer's
design.</p>

<p>Wickliffe was ignorant indeed of Greek and Hebrew; but was
it nothing to shake off the dust which for ages had covered the
Latin Bible, and to translate it into English? He was a good
Latin scholar, of sound understanding and great penetration;
but above all he loved the Bible, he understood it, and desired
to communicate this treasure to others. Let us imagine him
in his quiet study: on his table is the Vulgate text, corrected
after the best manuscripts; and lying open around him are the
commentaries of the doctors of the church, especially those of
St. Jerome and Nicholas Lyrensis. Between ten and fifteen
years he steadily prosecuted his task; learned men aided him
with their advice, and one of them, Nicholas Hereford, appears
to have translated a few chapters for him. At last in 1380 it
was completed. This was a great event in the religious history
of England, who, outstripping the nations on the continent, took
her station in the foremost rank in the great work of disseminating
the Scriptures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION OF THE CLERGY.</div>

<p>As soon as the translation was finished, the labour of the
copyists began, and the Bible was erelong widely circulated
either wholly or in portions. The reception of the work surpassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Wickliffe's expectations. The Holy Scriptures exercised
a reviving influence over men's hearts; minds were enlightened;
souls were converted; the voices of the "poor priests" had done
little in comparison with this voice; something new had entered
into the world. Citizens, soldiers, and the lower classes welcomed
this new era with acclamations; the high-born curiously
examined the unknown book; and even Anne of Luxemburg,
wife of Richard II, having learnt English, began to read the
Gospels diligently. She did more than this: she made them
known to Arundel, archbishop of York and chancellor, and
afterwards a persecutor, but who now, struck at the sight of a
foreign lady&mdash;of a queen, humbly devoting her leisure to the
study of <i>such virtuous books</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> commenced reading them
himself, and rebuked the prelates who neglected this holy pursuit.
"You could not meet two persons on the highway," says
a contemporary writer, "but one of them was Wickliffe's
disciple."</p>

<p>Yet all in England did not equally rejoice: the lower clergy
opposed this enthusiasm with complaints and maledictions.
"Master John Wickliffe, by translating the Gospel into English,"
said the monks, "has rendered it more acceptable and more intelligible
to laymen and even to women, than it had hitherto
been to learned and intelligent clerks!... The Gospel pearl
is every where cast out and trodden under foot of swine."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
New contests arose for the reformer. Wherever he bent his
steps, he was violently attacked. "It is heresy," cried the
monks, "to speak of Holy Scripture in English."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>&mdash;"Since the
church has approved of the four Gospels, she would have been
just as able to reject them and admit others! The church
sanctions and condemns what she pleases.... Learn to believe
in the church rather than in the Gospel." These clamours did
not alarm Wickliffe. "Many nations have had the Bible in
their own language. The Bible is the faith of the church.
Though the pope and all his clerks should disappear from the
face of the earth," said he, "our faith would not fail, for it is
founded on Jesus alone, our Master and our God." But Wickliffe
did not stand alone: in the palace as in the cottage, and
even in parliament, the rights of Holy Scripture found defenders.
A motion having been made in the Upper House (1390) to
seize all the copies of the Bible, the Duke of Lancaster exclaimed:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>"Are we then the very dregs of humanity, that we cannot
possess the laws of our religion in our own tongue?"<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSUBSTANTIATION.</div>

<p>Having given his fellow-countrymen the Bible, Wickliffe began
to reflect on its contents. This was a new step in his
onward path. There comes a moment when the Christian, saved
by a lively faith, feels the need of giving an account to himself
of this faith, and this originates the science of theology. This
is a natural movement: if the child, who at first possesses sensations
and affections only, feels the want, as he grows up, of reflection
and knowledge, why should it not be the same with the
Christian? Politics&mdash;home missions&mdash;Holy Scripture&mdash;had engaged
Wickliffe in succession; theology had its turn, and this
was the fourth phase of his life. Yet he did not penetrate to
the same degree as the men of the sixteenth century into the
depths of the Christian doctrine; and he attached himself in a
more especial manner to those ecclesiastical dogmas which were
more closely connected with the presumptuous hierarchy and
the simoniacal gains of Rome,&mdash;such as transubstantiation. The
Anglo-Saxon church had not professed this doctrine. "The
host is the body of Christ, not bodily but spiritually," said Elfric
in the tenth century in a letter addressed to the archbishop of
York; but Lanfranc, the opponent of Berengarius, had taught
England that at the word of a priest God quitted heaven and
descended on the altar. Wickliffe undertook to overthrow the
pedestal on which the pride of the priesthood was founded.
"The eucharist is naturally bread and wine," he taught at
Oxford in 1381; "but by virtue of the sacramental words it
contains in every part the real body and blood of Christ." He
did not stop here. "The consecrated wafer which we see on
the altar," said he, "is not Christ, nor any part of him, but his
efficient sign."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> He oscillated between these two shades of
doctrine; but to the first he more habitually attached himself.
He denied the sacrifice of the mass offered by the priest, because
it was substituted for the sacrifice of the cross offered up by
Jesus Christ; and rejected transubstantiation, because it nullified
the spiritual and living presence of the Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE'S FIRMNESS.</div>

<p>When Wickliffe's enemies heard these propositions, they
appeared horror-stricken, and yet in secret they were delighted
at the prospect of destroying him. They met together, examined
twelve theses he had published, and pronounced against him
suspension from all teaching, imprisonment, and the greater
excommunication. At the same time his friends became alarmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their zeal cooled, and many of them forsook him. The Duke
of Lancaster, in particular, could not follow him into this new
sphere. That prince had no objection to an ecclesiastical opposition
which might aid the political power, and for that purpose
he had tried to enlist the reformer's talents and courage; but he
feared a dogmatic opposition that might compromise him. The
sky was heavy with clouds; Wickliffe was alone.</p>

<p>The storm soon burst upon him. One day, while seated in
his doctoral chair in the Augustine school, and calmly explaining
the nature of the eucharist, an officer entered the hall, and
read the sentence of condemnation. It was the design of his
enemies to humble the professor in the eyes of his disciples.
Lancaster immediately became alarmed, and hastening to his
old friend begged him&mdash;ordered him even&mdash;to trouble himself
no more about this matter. Attacked on every side, Wickliffe
for a time remained silent. Shall he sacrifice the truth to save
his reputation&mdash;his repose&mdash;perhaps his life? Shall expediency
get the better of faith,&mdash;Lancaster prevail over Wickliffe? No:
his courage was invincible. "Since the year of our Lord 1000,"
said he, "all the doctors have been in error about the sacrament
of the altar&mdash;except, perhaps, it may be Berengarius.
How canst thou, O priest, who art but a man, make thy Maker?

Wickliffe called upon his adversaries to refute the opinions they
had condemned, and finding that they threatened him with a
civil penalty (imprisonment), he appealed to the king.</p>

<p>The time was not favourable for such an appeal. A fatal
circumstance increased Wickliffe's danger. Wat Tyler and a
dissolute priest named Ball, taking advantage of the ill-will
excited by the rapacity and brutality of the royal tax-gatherers,
had occupied London with 100,000 men. John Ball kept up
the spirits of the insurgents, not by expositions of the gospel,
like Wickliffe's <i>poor priests</i>, but by fiery comments on the distich
they had chosen for their device:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONDEMNED PROPOSITIONS.</div>

<p>There were many who felt no scruple in ascribing these disorders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to the reformer, who was quite innocent of them; and Courtenay,
bishop of London, having been translated to the see of
Canterbury, lost no time in convoking a synod to pronounce on
this matter of Wickliffe's. They met in the middle of May,
about two o'clock in the afternoon, and were proceeding to pronounce
sentence when an earthquake, which shook the city of
London and all Britain, so alarmed the members of the council
that they unanimously demanded the adjournment of a decision
which appeared so manifestly rebuked by God. But the archbishop
skilfully turned this strange phenomenon to his own
purposes: "Know you not," said he, "that the noxious vapours
which catch fire in the bosom of the earth, and give rise to these
phenomena which alarm you, loose all their force when they
burst forth? Well, in like manner, by rejecting the wicked
from our community, we shall put an end to the convulsions of
the church." The bishops regained their courage; and one of
the primate's officers read ten propositions, said to be Wickliffe's,
but ascribing to him certain errors of which he was quite innocent.
The following most excited the anger of the priests:
"God must obey the devil.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> After Urban VI we must receive
no one as pope, but live according to the manner of the <i>Greeks</i>."
The ten propositions were condemned as heretical, and the archbishop
enjoined all persons to shun, as they would a venomous
serpent, all who should preach the aforesaid errors. "If we
permit this heretic to appeal continually to the passions of the
people," said the primate to the king, "our destruction is inevitable.
We must silence these <i>lollards</i>&mdash;these psalm-singers."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The king gave authority "to confine in the prisons of the state
any who should maintain the condemned propositions."</p>

<p>Day by day the circle contracted around Wickliffe. The
prudent Repingdon, the learned Hereford, and even the eloquent
Ashton, the firmest of the three, departed from him. The
veteran champion of the truth which had once gathered a whole
nation round it, had reached the days when "strong men shall
bow themselves," and now, when harassed by persecution, he
found himself alone. But boldly he uplifted his hoary head and
exclaimed: "The doctrine of the gospel shall never perish; and
if the earth once quaked, it was because they condemned Jesus
Christ."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE BEFORE THE PRIMATE.</div>

<p>He did not stop here. In proportion as his physical strength
decreased, his moral strength increased. Instead of parrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the blows aimed at him, he resolved on dealing more terrible
ones still. He knew that if the king and the nobility were for
the priests, the lower house and the citizens were for liberty
and truth. He therefore presented a bold petition to the
Commons in the month of November 1382. "Since Jesus
Christ shed his blood to free his church, I demand its freedom.
I demand that every one may leave those gloomy walls [the
convents], within which a tyrannical law prevails, and embrace
a simple and peaceful life under the open vault of heaven. I
demand that the poor inhabitants of our towns and villages be
not constrained to furnish a worldly priest, often a vicious man
and a heretic, with the means of satisfying his ostentation, his
gluttony, and his licentiousness&mdash;of buying a showy horse,
costly saddles, bridles with tinkling bells, rich garments, and
soft furs, while they see their wives, children, and neighbours,
dying of hunger."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The House of Commons, recollecting that
they had not given their consent to the persecuting statute
drawn up by the clergy and approved by the king and the lords,
demanded its repeal. Was the Reformation about to begin by
the will of the people?</p>

<p>Courtenay, indignant at this intervention of the Commons,
and ever stimulated by a zeal for his church, which would have
been better directed towards the word of God, visited Oxford in
November 1382, and having gathered round him a number of
bishops, doctors, priests, students, and laymen, summoned Wickliffe
before him. Forty years ago the reformer had come up to
the university: Oxford had become his home ... and now
it was turning against him! Weakened by labours, by trials,
by that ardent soul which preyed upon his feeble body, he might
have refused to appear. But Wickliffe, who never feared the
face of man, came before them with a good conscience. We
may conjecture that there were among the crowd some disciples
who felt their hearts burn at the sight of their master; but no
outward sign indicated their emotion. The solemn silence of a
court of justice had succeeded the shouts of enthusiastic youths.
Yet Wickliffe did not despair: he raised his venerable head, and
turned to Courtenay with that confident look which had made
the regents of Oxford shrink away. Growing wroth against the
<i>priests of Baal</i>, he reproached them with disseminating error in
order to sell their masses. Then he stopped, and uttered these
simple and energetic words: "The truth shall prevail!"<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
thus spoken he prepared to leave the court: his enemies
dared not say a word; and, like his divine master at Nazareth,
he passed through the midst of them, and no man ventured to
stop him. He then withdrew to his cure at Lutterworth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE SUMMONED TO ROME.</div>

<p>He had not yet reached the harbour. He was living peacefully
among his books and his parishioners, and the priests seemed
inclined to leave him alone, when another blow was aimed at
him. A papal brief summoned him to Rome, to appear before
that tribunal which had so often shed the blood of its adversaries.
His bodily infirmities convinced him that he could not obey
this summons. But if Wickliffe refused to hear Urban, Urban
could not choose but hear Wickliffe. The church was at that
time divided between two chiefs: France, Scotland, Savoy, Lorraine,
Castile, and Aragon acknowledged Clement VII; while
Italy, England, Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Hungary acknowledged
Urban VI. Wickliffe shall tell us who is the true
head of the church universal. And while the two popes were
excommunicating and abusing each other, and selling heaven
and earth for their own gain, the reformer was confessing that
incorruptible Word, which establishes real unity in the church.
"I believe," said he, "that the Gospel of Christ is the whole
body of God's law. I believe that Christ, who gave it to us, is
very God and very man, and that this Gospel revelation is,
accordingly, superior to all other parts of Holy Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> I
believe that the bishop of Rome is bound more than all other
men to submit to it, for the greatness among Christ's disciples
did not consist in worldly dignity or honours, but in the exact
following of Christ in his life and manners. No faithful man
ought to follow the pope, but in such points as he hath followed
Jesus Christ. The pope ought to leave unto the secular power
all temporal dominion and rule; and thereunto effectually more
and more exhort his whole clergy.... If I could labour
according to my desire in mine own person, I would surely
present myself before the bishop of Rome, but the Lord hath
otherwise visited me to the contrary, and hath taught me rather
to obey God than men."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Urban, who at that moment chanced to be very busied in
his contest with Clement, did not think it prudent to begin
another with Wickliffe, and so let the matter rest there. From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
time the doctor passed the remainder of his days in peace in the
company of three personages, two of whom were his particular
friends, and the third his constant adversary: these were <i>Aletheia</i>,
<i>Phronesis</i>, and <i>Pseudes</i>. <i>Aletheia</i> (truth) proposed
questions; <i>Pseudes</i> (falsehood) urged objections; and <i>Phronesis</i>
(understanding) laid down the sound doctrine. These three
characters carried on a conversation (<i>trialogue</i>) in which great
truths were boldly professed. The opposition between the pope
and Christ&mdash;between the canons of Romanism and the Bible&mdash;was
painted in striking colours. This is one of the primary
truths which the church must never forget. "The church has
fallen," said one of the interlocutors in the work in question,
"because she has abandoned the Gospel, and preferred the laws
of the pope. Although there should be a hundred popes in the
world at once, and all the friars living should be transformed
into cardinals, we must withhold our confidence unless so far as
they are founded in Holy Scripture."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF WICKLIFFE.</div>

<p>These words were the last flicker of the torch. Wickliffe
looked upon his end as near, and entertained no idea that it
would come in peace. A dungeon on one of the seven hills, or
a burning pile in London, was all he expected. "Why do you
talk of seeking the crown of martyrdom afar?" asked he.
"Preach the Gospel of Christ to haughty prelates, and martyrdom
will not fail you. What! I should live and be silent? ...
never! Let the blow fall, I await its coming."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>The stroke was spared him. The war between two wicked
priests, Urban and Clement, left the disciples of our Lord in
peace. And besides, was it worth while cutting short a life
that was drawing to a close? Wickliffe, therefore, continued
tranquilly to preach Jesus Christ; and on the 29th December
1384, as he was in his church at Lutterworth, in the midst of
his flock, at the very moment that he stood before the altar,
and was elevating the host with trembling hands, he fell upon
the pavement struck with paralysis. He was carried to his
house by the affectionate friends around him, and after lingering
forty-eight hours resigned his soul to God on the last day
of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>Thus was removed from the church one of the boldest witnesses
to the truth. The seriousness of his language, the holiness
of his life, and the energy of his faith, had intimidated the
popedom. Travellers relate that if a lion is met in the desert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it is sufficient to look steadily at him, and the beast turns away
roaring from the eye of man. Wickliffe had fixed the eye of a
Christian on the papacy, and the affrighted papacy had left him
in peace. Hunted down unceasingly while living, he died in
quiet, at the very moment when by faith he was eating the
flesh and drinking the blood which give eternal life. A glorious
end to a glorious life.</p>

<p>The Reformation of England had begun.</p>

<p>Wickliffe is the greatest English Reformer: he was in truth
the first reformer of Christendom, and to him, under God,
Britain is indebted for the honour of being the foremost in the
attack upon the theocratic system of Gregory VII. The work
of the Waldenses, excellent as it was, cannot be compared to his.
If Luther and Calvin are the fathers of the Reformation,
Wickliffe is its grandfather.</p>

<p>Wickliffe, like most great men, possessed qualities which are
not generally found together. While his understanding was
eminently speculative&mdash;his treatise on the <i>Reality of universal
Ideas</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> made a sensation in philosophy&mdash;he possessed that practical
and active mind which characterizes the Anglo-Saxon race.
As a divine, he was at once scriptural and spiritual, soundly
orthodox, and possessed of an inward and lively faith. With a
boldness that impelled him to rush into the midst of danger, he
combined a logical and consistent mind, which constantly led
him forward in knowledge, and caused him to maintain with
perseverance the truths he had once proclaimed. First of all,
as a Christian, he had devoted his strength to the cause of the
church; but he was at the same time a citizen, and the realm,
his nation, and his king, had also a great share in his unwearied
activity. He was a man complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WICKLIFFE'S ECCLESIASTICAL VIEWS.</div>

<p>If the man is admirable, his teaching is no less so. Scripture,
which is the rule of truth, should be (according to his views)
the rule of Reformation, and we must reject every doctrine and
every precept which does not rest on that foundation.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> To believe
in the power of man in the work of regeneration is the

to God is worse than Pelagianism.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Christ is every thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>

sublimest calling which man can attain on earth is that of
preaching the word of God. The true church is the assembly

It is possible for a pope to be condemned at the last day because
of his sins. Would men compel us to recognise as our head
"a devil of hell?"<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Such were the essential points of Wickliffe's
doctrine. It was the echo of the doctrine of the apostles&mdash;the
prelude to that of the reformers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPHECY.</div>

<p>In many respects Wickliffe is the Luther of England; but the
times of revival had not yet come, and the English reformer
could not gain such striking victories over Rome as the German
reformer. While Luther was surrounded by an ever-increasing
number of scholars and princes, who confessed the same
faith as himself, Wickliffe shone almost alone in the firmament
of the church. The boldness with which he substituted a living
spirituality for a superstitious formalism, caused those to shrink
back in affright who had gone with him against friars, priests,
and popes. Erelong the Roman pontiff ordered him to be
thrown into prison, and the monks threatened his life;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> but
God protected him, and he remained calm amidst the machinations
of his adversaries. "Antichrist," said he, "can only kill
the body." Having one foot in the grave already, he foretold
that, from the very bosom of monkery, would some day proceed
the regeneration of the church. "If the friars, whom God
condescends to teach, shall be converted to the primitive religion
of Christ," said he, "we shall see them abandoning their
unbelief, returning freely, with or without the permission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Antichrist, to the primitive religion of the Lord, and building
up the church, as did St. Paul."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Wickliffe's piercing glance discover, at the distance
of nearly a century and a half, the young monk Luther in the
Augustine convent at Erfurth, converted by the Epistle to the
Romans, and returning to the spirit of St. Paul and the religion
of Jesus Christ. Time was hastening on to the fulfilment of
this prophecy. "The rising sun of the Reformation," for so
has Wickliffe been called, had appeared above the horizon, and
its beams were no more to be extinguished. In vain will thick
clouds veil it at times; the distant hill-tops of Eastern Europe will
soon reflect its rays;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and its piercing light, increasing in
brightness, will pour over all the world, at the hour of the
church's renovation, floods of knowledge and of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CALL FOR REFORM.</div>

<p>Wickliffe's death manifested the power of his teaching.
The master being removed, his disciples set their hands to the
plough, and England was almost won over to the reformer's
doctrines. The Wickliffites recognized a ministry independent
of Rome, and deriving authority from the word of God alone.
"Every minister," said they, "can administer the sacraments
and confer the cure of souls as well as the pope." To the
licentious wealth of the clergy they opposed a Christian poverty,
and to the degenerate asceticism of the mendicant orders, a
spiritual and free life. The townsfolk crowded around these
humble preachers; the soldiers listened to them, armed with
sword and buckler to defend them;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> the nobility took down
the images from their baronial chapels;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and even the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
family was partly won over to the Reformation. England was
like a tree cut down to the ground, from whose roots fresh buds
are shooting out on every side, erelong to cover all the earth
beneath their shade.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>This augmented the courage of Wickliffe's disciples, and in
many places the people took the initiative in the reform. The
walls of St. Paul's and other cathedrals were hung with placards
aimed at the priests and friars, and the abuses of which
they were the defenders; and in 1395 the friends of the Gospel
petitioned parliament for a general reform. "The essence of
the worship which comes from Rome," said they, "consists in
signs and ceremonies, and not in the efficacity of the Holy
Ghost: and therefore it is not that which Christ has ordained.
Temporal things are distinct from spiritual things: a king and
a bishop ought not to be one and the same person."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> And
then, from not clearly understanding the principle of the separation
of the functions which they proclaimed, they called upon
parliament to "abolish celibacy, transubstantiation, prayers for
the dead, offerings to images, auricular confession, war, the arts
unnecessary to life, the practice of blessing oil, salt, wax, incense,
stones, mitres, and pilgrims' staffs. All these pertain to
necromancy and not to theology." Emboldened by the absence
of the king in Ireland, they fixed their <i>Twelve Conclusions</i>
on the gates of St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey. This became
the signal for persecution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST MARTYR.</div>

<p>As soon as Arundel, archbishop of York, and Braybrooke,
bishop of London, had read these propositions, they hastily
crossed St. George's channel, and conjured the king to return to
England. The prince hesitated not to comply, for his wife, the
pious Anne of Luxemburg, was dead. Richard, during childhood
and youth, had been committed in succession to the
charge of several guardians, and like children (says an historian),
whose nurses have been often changed, he thrived none the better
for it. He did good or evil, according to the influence of
those around him, and had no decided inclinations except for
ostentation and licentiousness. The clergy were not mistaken
in calculating on such a prince. On his return to London he
forbade the parliament to take the Wickliffite petition into consideration;
and having summoned before him the most distinguished
of its supporters, such as Story, Clifford, Latimer, and
Montacute, he threatened them with death if they continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
defend their abominable opinions. Thus was the work of the
reformer about to be destroyed.</p>

<p>But Richard had hardly withdrawn his hand from the Gospel,
when God (says the annalist) withdrew his hand from him.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
His cousin, Henry of Hereford, son of the famous duke of Lancaster,
and who had been banished from England, suddenly
sailed from the continent, landed in Yorkshire, gathered all the
malcontents around him, and was acknowledged king. The
unhappy Richard, after being formally deposed, was confined
in Pontefract castle, where he soon terminated his earthly
career.</p>

<p>The son of Wickliffe's old defender was now king: a reform
of the church seemed imminent; but the primate Arundel had
foreseen the danger. This cunning priest and skilful politician
had observed which way the wind blew, and deserted Richard
in good time. Taking Lancaster by the hand, he put the crown
on his head, saying to him: "To consolidate your throne, conciliate
the clergy, and sacrifice the Lollards."&mdash;"I will be the
protector of the church," replied Henry IV, and from that
hour the power of the priests was greater than the power of
the nobility. Rome has ever been adroit in profiting by revolutions.</p>

<p>Lancaster, in his eagerness to show his gratitude to the
priests, ordered that every incorrigible heretic should be burnt
alive, to terrify his companions.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Practice followed close upon
the theory. A pious priest named William Sawtre had
presumed to say: "Instead of adoring the cross on which
Christ suffered, I adore Christ who suffered on it."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> He
was dragged to St. Paul's; his hair was shaved off; a layman's
cap was placed on his head; and the primate handed him over
to the <i>mercy</i> of the earl-marshal of England. This mercy was
shown him&mdash;he was burnt alive at Smithfield in the beginning
of March, 1401. Sawtre was the first martyr to protestantism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD COBHAM.</div>

<p>Encouraged by this act of faith&mdash;this <i>auto da fé</i>&mdash;the clergy
drew up the articles known as the "Constitutions of Arundel,"
which forbade the reading of the Bible, and styled the pope,
"not a mere man, but a true God."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The Lollards' tower, in
the archiepiscopal palace of Lambeth, was soon filled with pretended
heretics, many of whom carved on the walls of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
dungeons the expression of their sorrow and their hopes: <i>Jesus
amor meus</i>, wrote one of them.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>To crush the lowly was not enough: the Gospel must be
driven from the more exalted stations. The priests, who were
sincere in their belief, regarded those noblemen as misleaders,
who set the word of God above the laws of Rome; and accordingly
they girded themselves for the work. A few miles from
Rochester stood Cowling Castle, in the midst of the fertile pastures
watered by the Medway,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">The fair Medwaya that with wanton pride<br /></span>

</div>

<p>In the beginning of the fifteenth century it was inhabited by
Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, a man in high favour with
the king. The "poor priests" thronged to Cowling in quest of
Wickliffe's writings, of which Cobham had caused numerous
copies to be made, and whence they were circulated through
the dioceses of Canterbury, Rochester, London, and Hertford.
Cobham attended their preaching, and if any enemies ventured
to interrupt them, he threatened them with his sword.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> "I
would sooner risk my life," said he, "than submit to such
unjust decrees as dishonour the everlasting Testament." The
king would not permit the clergy to lay hands on his favourite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COBHAM BEFORE THE ARCHBISHOP.</div>

<p>But Henry V having succeeded his father in 1413, and
passed from the houses of ill-fame he had hitherto frequented,
to the foot of the altars and the head of the armies, the archbishop
immediately denounced Cobham to him, and he was
summoned to appear before the king. Sir John had understood
Wickliffe's doctrine, and experienced in his own person the
might of the divine Word. "As touching the pope and his
spirituality," he said to the king, "I owe them neither suit nor
service, forasmuch as I know him by the Scriptures to be the
great antichrist."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Henry thrust aside Cobham's hand as he
presented his confession of faith: "I will not receive this paper,
lay it before your judges." When he saw his profession refused,
Cobham had recourse to the only arm which he knew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
out of the Gospel. The differences which we now settle by
pamphlets were then very commonly settled by the sword:&mdash;"I
offer in defence of my faith to fight for life or death with any
man living, Christian or pagan, always excepting your majesty."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Cobham was led to the Tower.</p>

<p>On the 23rd September, 1413, he was taken before the
ecclesiastical tribunal then sitting at St. Paul's. "We must
believe," said the primate to him, "what the holy church of
Rome teaches, without demanding Christ's authority."&mdash;"Believe!"
shouted the priests, "believe!"&mdash;"I am willing to believe
all that God desires," said Sir John; "but that the pope should
have authority to teach what is contrary to Scripture&mdash;that I
can never believe." He was led back to the Tower. The word
of God was to have its martyr.</p>

<p>On Monday, 25th September, a crowd of priests, canons,
friars, clerks, and indulgence-sellers, thronged the large hall of
the Dominican convent, and attacked Lord Cobham with abusive
language. These insults, the importance of the moment for
the Reformation of England, the catastrophe that must needs
close the scene: all agitated his soul to its very depths. When
the archbishop called upon him to confess his offence, he fell on
his knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, exclaimed: "I
confess to Thee, O God! and acknowledge that in my frail
youth I seriously offended Thee by my pride, anger, intemperance,
and impurity: for these offences I implore thy mercy!"
Then standing up, his face still wet with tears, he said: "I ask
not your absolution: it is God's only that I need."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The clergy
did not despair, however, of reducing this high-spirited gentleman:
they knew that spiritual strength is not always conjoined
with bodily vigour, and they hoped to vanquish by priestly
sophisms the man who dared challenge the papal champions to
single combat. "Sir John," said the primate at last, "You
have said some very strange things; we have spent much time
in endeavours to convince you, but all to no effect. The day
passeth away: you must either submit yourself to the ordinance
of the most holy church...." "I will none otherwise
believe than what I have told you. Do with me what you will."&mdash;"Well
then, we must needs do the law," the archbishop
made answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LOLLARDS.</div>

<p>Arundel stood up; all the priests and people rose with him
and uncovered their heads. Then holding the sentence of death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in his hand, he read it with a loud clear voice. "It is well,"
said Sir John; "though you condemn my body, you can do no
harm to my soul, by the grace of my eternal God." He was
again led back to the Tower, whence he escaped one night, and
took refuge in Wales. He was retaken in December, 1417,
carried to London, dragged on a hurdle to Saint Giles's fields,
and there suspended by chains over a slow fire, and cruelly
burned to death. Thus died a Christian, illustrious after the
fashion of his age&mdash;a champion of the Word of God. The
London prisons were filled with Wickliffites, and it was decreed
that they should be hung on the king's account, and burnt for
God's.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The intimidated Lollards were compelled to hide themselves
in the humblest ranks of the people, and to hold their meetings
in secret. The work of redemption was proceeding noiselessly
among the elect of God. Of these Lollards, there were many
who had been redeemed by Jesus Christ; but in general they
knew not, to the same extent as the evangelical Christians of
the sixteenth century, the quickening and justifying power of
faith. They were plain, meek, and often timid folks, attracted
by the word of God, affected at the condemnation it pronounces
against the errors of Rome, and desirous of living according to
its commandments. God had assigned them a part&mdash;and an
important part too&mdash;in the great transformation of Christianity.
Their humble piety, their passive resistance, the shameful treatment
which they bore with resignation, the penitent's robes
with which they were covered, the tapers they were compelled
to hold at the church door&mdash;all these things betrayed the pride
of the priests, and filled the most generous minds with doubts
and vague desires. By a baptism of suffering, God was then
preparing the way to a glorious reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING AT FLORENCE.</div>

<p>This reformation was to be the result of two distinct forces&mdash;the
revival of learning and the resurrection of the word of
God. The latter was the principal cause, but the former was
necessary as a means. Without it the living waters of the
Gospel would probably have traversed the age, like summer
streams which soon dry up, such as those which had burst forth
here and there during the middle ages; it would not have become
that majestic river, which, by its inundations, fertilized
all the earth. It was necessary to discover and examine the
original fountains, and for this end the study of Greek and
Hebrew was indispensable. Lollardism and humanism (the
study of the classics) were the two laboratories of the reform.
We have seen the preparations of the one, we must now trace
the commencement of the other; and as we have discovered the
light in the lowly valleys, we shall discern it also on the lofty
mountain tops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TUDORS.</div>

<p>About the end of the fifteenth century, several young Englishmen
chanced to be at Florence, attracted thither by the
literary glory which environed the city of the Medici. Cosmo
had collected together a great number of works of antiquity,
and his palace was thronged with learned men. William Selling,
a young English ecclesiastic, afterwards distinguished at
Canterbury by his zeal in collecting valuable manuscripts; his
fellow-countrymen, Grocyn, Lilly, and Latimer "more bashful
than a maiden;"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and, above all, Linacre, whom Erasmus ranked
before all the scholars of Italy,&mdash;used to meet in the delicious
villa of the Medici with Politian, Chalcondyles, and other men
of learning; and there, in the calm evenings of summer, under
that glorious Tuscan sky, they dreamt romantic visions of the
Platonic philosophy. When they returned to England, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
learned men laid before the youth of Oxford the marvellous
treasures of the Greek language. Some Italians even, attracted
by the desire to enlighten the barbarians, and a little, it may
be, by the brilliant offers made them, quitted their beloved
country for the distant Britain. Cornelius Vitelli taught at
Oxford, and Caius Amberino at Cambridge. Caxton imported
the art of printing from Germany, and the nation hailed with
enthusiasm the brilliant dawn which was breaking at last in
their cloudy sky.</p>

<p>While learning was reviving in England, a new dynasty succeeded
to the throne, bringing with it that energy of character
which of itself is able to effect great revolutions; the Tudors
succeeded the Plantagenets. That inflexible intrepidity by
which the reformers of Germany, Switzerland, France, and
Scotland were distinguished, did not exist so generally in those
of England; but it was found in the character of her kings, who
often stretched it even to violence. It may be that to this preponderance
of energy in its rulers, the church owes the preponderance
of the state in its affairs.</p>

<p>Henry Tudor, the Louis XI of England, was a clever prince,
of decided but suspicious character, avaricious and narrow-minded.
Being descended from a Welsh family, he belonged to
that ancient race of Celts, who had so long contended against
the papacy. Henry had extinguished faction at home, and
taught foreign nations to respect his power. A good genius
seemed to exercise a salutary influence over his court as well as
over himself: this was his mother, the Countess of Richmond.
From her closet, where she consecrated the first five hours of
the day to reading, meditation, and prayer, she moved to another
part of the palace to dress the wounds of some of the
lowest mendicants; thence she passed into the gay saloons,
where she would converse with the scholars, whom she encouraged
by her munificence. This noble lady's passion for study,
of which her son inherited but little, was not without its influence
in her family. Arthur and Henry, the king's eldest sons,
trembled in their father's presence; but, captivated by the affection
of their pious grandmother, they began to find a pleasure
in the society of learned men. An important circumstance
gave a new impulse to one of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Among the countess's friends was Montjoy, who had known
Erasmus at Paris, and heard his cutting sarcasms upon the
schoolmen and friars. He invited the illustrious Dutchman to
England, and Erasmus, who was fearful of catching the plague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
gladly accepted the invitation, and set out for what he believed
to be the kingdom of darkness. But he had not been long in
England before he discovered unexpected light.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival, happening to dine with the lord-mayor,
Erasmus noticed on the other side of the table a young
man of nineteen, slender, fresh-coloured, with blue eyes, coarse
hands, and the right shoulder somewhat higher than the other.
His features indicated affability and gaiety, and pleasant jests
were continually dropping from his lips. If he could not find
a joke in English, he would in French, and even in Latin or
Greek. A literary contest soon ensued between Erasmus and
the English youth. The former, astonished at meeting with
any one that could hold his own against him, exclaimed: <i>Aut
tu es Morus aut nullus!</i> (you are either More or nobody); and
his companion, who had not learnt the stranger's name, quickly
replied: <i>Aut tu es Erasmus aut diabolus!</i> (you are either the
devil or Erasmus).<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> More flung himself into the arms of Erasmus,
and they became inseparable friends. More was continually
joking, even with women, teasing the young maidens, and
making fun of the dull, though without any tinge of ill-nature
in his jests.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> But under this sportive exterior he concealed a
deep understanding. He was at that time lecturing on Augustine's
'<i>City of God</i>' before a numerous audience composed of
priests and aged men. The thought of eternity had seized him:
and being ignorant of that internal discipline of the Holy Ghost,
which is the only true discipline, he had recourse to the scourge
on every Friday. Thomas More is the ideal of the catholicism
of this period. He had, like the Romish system, two poles&mdash;worldliness
and asceticism; which, although contrary, often
meet together. In fact, asceticism makes a sacrifice of <i>self</i>,
only to preserve it; just as a traveller attacked by robbers will
readily give up a portion of his treasures to save the rest. This
was the case with More, if we rightly understand his character.
He sacrificed the accessories of his fallen nature to save that
same nature. He submitted to fasts and vigils, wore a shirt of
hair-cloth, mortified his body by small chains next his skin&mdash;in
a word, he immolated every thing in order to preserve that <i>self</i>
which a real regeneration alone can sacrifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROYAL SCHOOL-ROOM.</div>

<p>From London Erasmus went to Oxford, where he met with
John Colet, a friend of More's, but older, and of very dissimilar
character. Colet, the scion of an ancient family, was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
portly man, of imposing aspect, great fortune, and elegance of
manners, to which Erasmus had not been accustomed. Order,
cleanliness, and decorum prevailed in his person and in his
house. He kept an excellent table, which was open to all the
friends of learning, and at which the Dutchman, no great admirer
of the colleges of Paris with their sour wine and stale
eggs, was glad to take a seat.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He there met also most of the
classical scholars of England, especially Grocyn, Linacre, Thomas
Wolsey, bursar of Magdalene College, Halsey, and some others.
"I cannot tell you how I am delighted with your England," he
wrote to Lord Montjoy from Oxford. "With such men I could
willingly live in the farthest coasts of Scythia."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARTHUR AND CATHERINE.</div>

<p>But if Erasmus on the banks of the Thames found a Mæcenas
in Lord Montjoy, a Labeo and perhaps a Virgil in More, he nowhere
found an Augustus. One day as he was expressing his
regrets and his fears to More, the latter said: "Come, let us go
to Eltham, perhaps we shall find there what you are looking
for." They set out, More jesting all the way, inwardly resolving
to expiate his gaiety by a severe scourging at night. On
their arrival they were heartily welcomed by Lord and Lady
Montjoy, the governor and governess of the king's children.
As the two friends entered the hall, a pleasing and unexpected
sight greeted Erasmus. The whole of the family were assembled,
and they found themselves surrounded not only by some of the
royal household, but by the domestics of Lord Montjoy also.
On the right stood the Princess Margaret, a girl of eleven years,
whose great-grandson under the name of Stuart was to continue
the Tudor line in England; on the left was Mary, a child four
years of age; Edmund was in his nurse's arms; and in the middle
of the circle, between his two sisters, stood a boy, at that
time only nine years old, whose handsome features, royal carriage,
intelligent eye, and exquisite courtesy, had an extraordinary
charm for Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> That boy was Henry, Duke of York, the
king's second son, born on the 28th June 1491. More, advancing
towards the young prince, presented to him some piece of
his own writing; and from that hour Erasmus kept up a friendly
intercourse with Henry, which in all probability exercised a
certain influence over the destinies of England. The scholar of
Rotterdam was delighted to see the prince excel in all the manly
sports of the day. He sat his horse with perfect grace and rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
intrepidity, could hurl a javelin farther than any of his companions,
and having an excellent taste for music, he was already
a performer on several instruments. The king took care that
he should receive a learned education, for he destined him to
fill the see of Canterbury; and the illustrious Erasmus, noticing
his aptitude for every thing he undertook, did his best to cut
and polish this English diamond that it might glitter with the
greater brilliancy. "He will begin nothing that he will not
finish," said the scholar. And it is but too true, that this prince
always attained his end, even if it were necessary to tread on
the bleeding bodies of those he had loved. Flattered by the
attentions of the young Henry, attracted by his winning grace,
charmed by his wit, Erasmus on his return to the continent
everywhere proclaimed that England at last had found its Octavius.</p>

<p>As for Henry VII he thought of everything but Virgil or
Augustus. Avarice and ambition were his predominant tastes,
which he gratified by the marriage of his eldest son in 1501.
Burgundy, Artois, Provence, and Brittany having been recently
united to France, the European powers felt the necessity of
combining against that encroaching state. It was in consequence
of this that Ferdinand of Aragon had given his daughter Joanna
to Philip of Austria, and that Henry VII asked the hand of
his daughter Catherine, then in her sixteenth year and the richest
princess in Europe, for Arthur prince of Wales, a youth
about ten months younger. The catholic king made one condition
to the marriage of his daughter. Warwick, the last of
the Plantagenets and a pretender to the crown, was confined in
the Tower. Ferdinand, to secure the certainty that Catherine
would really ascend the English throne, required that the unhappy
prince should be put to death. Nor did this alone satisfy
the king of Spain. Henry VII, who was not a cruel man,
might conceal Warwick, and say that he was no more. Ferdinand
demanded that the chancellor of Castile should be present
at the execution. The blood of Warwick was shed; his head
rolled duly on the scaffold; the Castilian chancellor verified and
registered the murder, and on the 14th November the marriage
was solemnized at St. Paul's. At midnight the prince and
princess were conducted with great pomp to the bridal-chamber.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
These were ill-omened nuptials&mdash;fated to set the kings and nations
of Christendom in battle against each other, and to serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pretext for the external and political discussions of the English
Reformation. The marriage of Catherine the Catholic was a
marriage of blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF PRINCE ARTHUR.</div>

<p>In the early part of 1502 Prince Arthur fell ill, and on the
2nd of April he died. The necessary time was taken to be sure
that Catherine had no hope of becoming a mother, after which
the friend of Erasmus, the youthful Henry, was declared heir to
the crown, to the great joy of all the learned. This prince did
not forsake his studies: he spoke and wrote in French, German,
and Spanish with the facility of a native; and England hoped to
behold one day the most learned of Christian kings upon the
throne of Alfred the Great.</p>

<p>A very different question, however, filled the mind of the
covetous Henry VII. Must he restore to Spain the two hundred
thousand ducats which formed Catherine's dowry? Shall
this rich heiress be permitted to marry some rival of England?
To prevent so great a misfortune the king conceived the project
of uniting Henry to Arthur's widow. The most serious objections
were urged against it. "It is not only inconsistent with
propriety," said Warham, the primate, "but the will of God
himself is against it. It is declared in His law that <i>if a man
shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing</i>, (Lev. xx. 21);
and in the Gospel John Baptist says to Herod: <i>It is not lawful
for thee to have thy brother's wife</i>," (Mark vi. 18.) Fox, bishop of
Winchester, suggested that a dispensation might be procured
from the pope, and in December 1503 Julius II granted a bull
declaring that for the sake of preserving union between the
catholic princes he authorized Catherine's marriage with the
brother of her first husband, <i>accedente forsan copula carnali</i>.
These four words, it is said, were inserted in the bull at the
express desire of the princess. All these details will be of
importance in the course of our history. The two parties
were betrothed, but not married in consideration of the youth
of the prince of Wales.</p>

<p>The second marriage projected by Henry VII was ushered
in with auspices still less promising than the first. The king
having fallen sick and lost his queen, looked upon these visitations
as a divine judgment.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The nation murmured, and demanded
whether it was in the pope's power to permit what God
had forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The young prince, being informed of his father's
scruples and of the people's discontent, declared, just before attaining
his majority (27th June 1505), in the presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
bishop of Winchester and several royal counsellors, that he
protested against the engagement entered into during his minority,
and that he would never make Catherine his wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROCLAMATION OF HENRY VIII.</div>

<p>His father's death, which made him free, made him also recall
this virtuous decision. In 1509, the hopes of the learned
seemed about to be realized. On the 9th of May, a hearse
decorated with regal pomp, bearing on a rich pall of cloth of
gold the mortal remains of Henry VII with his sceptre and his
crown, entered London, followed by a long procession. The great
officers of state, assembled round the coffin, broke their staves
and cast them into the vault, and the heralds cried with a loud
voice: "God send the noble King Henry VIII long life."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Such
a cry perhaps had never on any previous occasion been so joyfully
repeated by the people. The young king gratified the
wishes of the nation by ordering the arrest of Empson and Dudley,
who were charged with extortion; and he conformed to the
enlightened counsels of his grandmother, by choosing the most
able ministers, and placing the archbishop of Canterbury as
lord-chancellor at their head. Warham was a man of great
capacity. The day was not too short for him to hear mass, receive
ambassadors, consult with the king in the royal closet,
entertain as many as two hundred guests at his table, take his
seat on the woolsack, and find time for his private devotions.
The joy of the learned surpassed that of the people. The old
king wanted none of their praises or congratulations, for fear he
should have to pay for them; but now they could give free
course to their enthusiasm. Montjoy pronounced the young
king "divine;" the Venetian ambassador likened his port to
Apollo's, and his noble chest to the torso of Mars; he was lauded
both in Greek and Latin; he was hailed as the founder of a
new era, and Henry seemed desirous of meriting these eulogiums.
Far from permitting himself to be intoxicated by so much adulation,
he said to Montjoy: "Ah! how I should like to be a
scholar!"&mdash;"Sire," replied the courtier, "It is enough that you
show your regard for those who possess the learning you desire
for yourself."&mdash;"How can I do otherwise," he replied with
earnestness; "without them we hardly exist!" Montjoy immediately
communicated this to Erasmus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTHUSIASM OF THE LEARNED.</div>

<p>Erasmus!&mdash;Erasmus!&mdash;the walls of Eltham, Oxford, and
London resounded with the name. The king could not live
without the learned; nor the learned without Erasmus. This
scholar, who was an enthusiast for the young king, was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
long in answering to the call. When Richard Pace, one of the
most accomplished men of that age, met the learned Dutchman
at Ferrara, the latter took from his pocket a little box which he
always carried with him: "You don't know," he said, "what a
treasure you have in England: I will just show you;" and he
took from the box a letter of Henry's expressing in Latin of
considerable purity the tenderest regard for his correspondent.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Immediately after the coronation Montjoy wrote to Erasmus:
"Our Henry <i>Octavus</i>, or rather <i>Octavius</i>, is on the throne.
Come and behold the new star.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The heavens smile, the earth
leaps for joy, and all is flowing with milk, nectar, and honey.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Avarice has fled away, liberality has descended, scattering on
every side with gracious hand her bounteous largesses. Our
king desires not gold or precious stones, but virtue, glory, and
immortality."</p>

<p>In such glowing terms was the young king described by a
man who had seen him closely. Erasmus could resist no longer:
he bade the pope farewell, and hastened to London, where he met
with a hearty welcome from Henry. Science and power embraced
each other: England was about to have its Medici; and
the friends of learning no longer doubted of the regeneration of
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROMWELL AND THE POPE.</div>

<p>Julius II, who had permitted Erasmus to exchange the white
frock of the monks for the black dress of the seculars,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> allowed
him to depart without much regret. This pontiff had little taste
for letters, but was fond of war, hunting, and the pleasures of
the table. The English sent him a dish to his taste in exchange
for the scholar. Sometime after Erasmus had left, as the pope
was one day reposing from the fatigues of the chase, he heard
voices near him singing a strange song. He asked with surprise
what it meant.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> "It is some Englishmen," was the answer, and
three foreigners entered the room, each bearing a closely-covered
jar, which the youngest presented on his knees. This was
Thomas Cromwell, who appears here for the first time on the
historic scene. He was the son of a blacksmith of Putney;
but he possessed a mind so penetrating, a judgment so sound,
a heart so bold, ability so consummate, such easy elocution,
such an accurate memory, such great activity, and so able a
pen, that the most brilliant career was foreboded him. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
age of twenty he left England, being desirous to see the world,
and began life as a clerk in the English factory at Antwerp.
Shortly after this two fellow-countrymen from Boston came to
him in their embarrassment. "What do you want?" he asked
them. "Our townsmen have sent us to the pope," they
told him, "to get the renewal of the <i>greater</i> and <i>lesser
pardons</i>, whose term is nearly run, and which are necessary for
the repair of our harbour. But we do not know how to appear
before him." Cromwell, prompt to undertake everything, and
knowing a little Italian, replied, "I will go with you." Then
slapping his forehead, he muttered to himself: "What fish can
I throw out as a bait to these greedy cormorants?" A friend
informed him that the pope was very fond of dainties. Cromwell
immediately ordered some exquisite jelly to be prepared,
after the English fashion, and set out for Italy with his provisions
and his two companions.</p>

<p>This was the man who appeared before Julius after his return
from the chase. "Kings and princes alone eat of this preserve
in England," said Cromwell to the pope. One cardinal, who
was a greedier "cormorant" than his master, eagerly tasted the
delicacy. "Try it," he exclaimed, and the pope, relishing this
new confectionary, immediately signed the pardons, on condition
however that the receipt for the jelly should be left with him.
"And thus were the <i>jelly-pardons</i> obtained," says the annalist.
It was Cromwell's first exploit, and the man who began his busy
career by presenting jars of confectionary to the pope was also
the man destined to separate England from Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S COURT.</div>

<p>The court of the pontiff was not the only one in Europe devoted
to gaiety. Hunting parties were as common in London
as at Rome. The young king and his companions were at that
time absorbed in balls, banquets, and the other festivities inseparable
from a new reign. He recollected however that he
must give a queen to his people: Catherine of Aragon was still
in England, and the council recommended her for his wife. He
admired her piety without caring to imitate it;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> he was pleased
with her love for literature, and even felt some inclination towards
her.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> His advisers represented to him that "Catherine,
daughter of the illustrious Isabella of Castile, was the image of
her mother. Like her, she possessed that wisdom and greatness
of mind which win the respect of nations; and that if she carried
to any of his rivals her marriage-portion and the Spanish alliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the long-contested crown of England would soon fall from
his head.... We have the pope's dispensation: will you
be more scrupulous than he is?"<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The archbishop of Canterbury
opposed in vain: Henry gave way, and on the eleventh of
June, about seven weeks after his father's death, the nuptials
were privately celebrated. On the twenty-third the king and
queen went in state through the city, the bride wearing a white
satin dress with her hair hanging down her back nearly to her
feet. On the next day they were crowned at Westminster with
great magnificence.</p>

<p>Then followed a series of expensive entertainments. The
treasures which the nobility had long concealed from fear of
the old king, were now brought out; the ladies glittered with
gold and diamonds; and the king and queen, whom the people
never grew tired of admiring, amused themselves like children
with the splendour of their royal robes. Henry VIII was the
forerunner of Louis XIV. Naturally inclined to pomp and
pleasure, the idol of his people, a devoted admirer of female
beauty, and the husband of almost as many wives as Louis had
adulterous mistresses, he made the court of England what the
son of Anne of Austria made the court of France,&mdash;one constant
scene of amusements. He thought he could never get to
the end of the riches amassed by his prudent father. His
youth&mdash;for he was only eighteen&mdash;the gaiety of his disposition,
the grace he displayed in all bodily exercises, the tales of chivalry
in which he delighted, and which even the clergy recommended
to their high-born hearers, the flattery of his courtiers<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>&mdash;all
these combined to set his young imagination in a ferment.
Wherever he appeared, all were filled with admiration of his
handsome countenance and graceful figure: such is the portrait
bequeathed to us by his greatest enemy.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> "His brow was
made to wear the crown, and his majestic port the kingly
mantle," adds Noryson.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S DANGER.</div>

<p>Henry resolved to realize without delay the chivalrous combats
and fabulous splendours of the heroes of the Round Table,
as if to prepare himself for those more real struggles which he
would one day have to maintain against the papacy. At the
sound of the trumpet the youthful monarch would enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lists, clad in costly armour, and wearing a plume that fell gracefully
down to the saddle of his vigorous courser; "like an untamed
bull," says an historian, "which breaks away from its
yoke and rushes into the arena." On one occasion, at the
celebration of the queen's churching, Catherine with her ladies
was seated in a tent of purple and gold, in the midst of an
artificial forest, strewn with rocks and variegated with flowers.
On a sudden a monk stepped forward, wearing a long brown
robe, and kneeling before her, begged permission to run a course.
It was granted, and rising up he threw aside his coarse frock,
and appeared gorgeously armed for the tourney. He was
Charles Brandon, afterwards Duke of Suffolk, one of the handsomest
and strongest men in the kingdom, and the first after
Henry in military exercises. He was followed by a number of
others dressed in black velvet, with wide-brimmed hats on their
heads, staffs in their hands, and scarfs across their shoulders
ornamented with cockle shells, like pilgrims from St. James of
Compostella. These also threw off their disguise, and stood
forth in complete armour. At their head was Sir Thomas
Boleyn, whose daughter was fated to surpass in beauty, greatness,
and misfortune, all the women of England. The tournament
began. Henry, who has been compared to Amadis in
boldness, to the lion hearted Richard in courage, and to Edward
III in courtesy, did not always escape danger in these chivalrous
contests. One day the king had forgotten to lower his
vizor, and Brandon, his opponent, setting off at full gallop, the
spectators noticed the oversight, and cried out in alarm. But
nothing could stop their horses: the two cavaliers met. Suffolk's
lance was shivered against Henry, and the fragments struck him
in the face. Every one thought the king was dead, and some
were running to arrest Brandon, when Henry, recovering from
the blow which had fallen on his helmet, recommenced the
combat, and ran six new courses amid the admiring cries of his
subjects. This intrepid courage changed as he grew older into
unsparing cruelty; and it was this young tiger, whose movements
were then so graceful, that at no distant day tore with his bloody
fangs the mother of his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE EXCITES TO WAR.</div>

<p>A message from the pope stopped Henry in the midst of these
amusements. In Scotland, Spain, France, and Italy, the young
king had nothing but friends; a harmony which the papacy was
intent on disturbing. One day, immediately after high-mass
had been celebrated, the archbishop of Canterbury, on behalf
of Julius II laid at his feet a golden rose, which had been
blessed by the pope, anointed with holy oil, and perfumed with
musk.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It was accompanied by a letter saluting him as head
of the Italian league. The warlike pontiff having reduced the
Venetians, desired to humble France, and to employ Henry as
the instrument of his vengeance. Henry, only a short time
before, had renewed his alliance with Louis XII; but the pope
was not to be baffled by such a trifle as that, and the young
king soon began to dream of rivalling the glories of Crecy,
Poitiers, and Agincourt. To no purpose did his wisest councillors
represent to him that England, in the most favourable
times, had never been able to hold her ground in France, and
that the sea was the true field open to her conquests. Julius,
knowing his vanity, had promised to deprive Louis of the title
of Most Christian king, and confer it upon him. "His holiness
hopes that your grace will utterly exterminate the king of
France," wrote the king's agent.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Henry saw nothing objectionable
in this very unapostolic mission, and decided on substituting
the terrible game of war for the gentler sports of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEAN COLET'S SERMON.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1511, after some unsuccessful attempts by
his generals, Henry determined to invade France in person. He
was in the midst of his preparations when the festival of Easter
arrived. Dean Colet had been appointed to preach before
Henry on Good Friday, and in the course of his sermon he
showed more courage than could have been expected in a scholar,
for a spark of the Christian spirit was glowing in his bosom.
He chose for the subject of his discourse Christ's victory over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
death and the grave. "Whoever takes up arms from ambition,"
said he, "fights not under the standard of Christ, but of Satan.
If you desire to contend against your enemies, follow Jesus
Christ as your prince and captain, rather than Cæsar or Alexander."
His hearers looked at each other with astonishment;
the friends of polite literature became alarmed; and the priests,
who were getting uneasy at the uprising of the human mind,
hoped to profit by this opportunity of inflicting a deadly blow
on their antagonists. There were among them men whose
opinions we must condemn, while we cannot forbear respecting
the zeal for what they believed to be the truth: of this number
were Bricot, Fitzjames, and above all Standish. Their zeal, however,
went a little too far on this occasion: they even talked of
<i>burning</i> the dean.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> After the sermon, Colet was informed that
the king requested his attendance in the garden of the Franciscan
monastery, and immediately the priests and monks crowded
round the gate, hoping to see their adversary led forth as a
criminal. "Let us be alone," said Henry; "put on your cap,
Mr. Dean, and we will take a walk. Cheer up," he continued,
"you have nothing to fear. You have spoken admirably of
Christian charity, and have almost reconciled me to the king of
France; yet, as the contest is not one of choice, but of necessity,
I must beg of you in some future sermon to explain this to my
people. Unless you do so, I fear my soldiers may misunderstand
your meaning." Colet was not a John Baptist, and, affected by
the king's condescension, he gave the required explanation. The
king was satisfied, and exclaimed: "Let every man have his
doctor as he pleases; this man is my doctor, and I will drink
his health!" Henry was then young: very different was the
fashion with which in after-years he treated those who opposed
him.</p>



<p>At heart the king cared little more about the victories of
Alexander than of Jesus Christ. Having fitted out his army,
he embarked at the end of June, accompanied by his almoner,
Wolsey, who was rising into favour, and set out for the war
as if for a tournament. Shortly after this, he went, all glittering
with jewels, to meet the Emperor Maximilian, who received
him in a plain doublet and cloak of black serge. After his
victory at the battle of Spurs, Henry, instead of pressing forward
to the conquest of France, returned to the siege of Teronenne,
wasted his time in jousts and entertainments, conferred on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Wolsey the bishopric of Tournay which he had just captured,
and then returned to England, delighted at having made so
pleasant an excursion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE OF PRINCESS MARY.</div>

<p>Louis XII was a widower in his 53rd year, and bowed down
by the infirmities of a premature old age; but being desirous of
preventing, at any cost, the renewal of the war, he sought the
hand of Henry's sister, the Princess Mary, then in her 16th
year. Her affections were already fixed on Charles Brandon,
and for him she would have sacrificed the splendour of a throne.
But reasons of state opposed their union. "The princess," remarked
Wolsey, "will soon return to England a widow with a
royal dowry." This decided the question. The disconsolate
Mary, who was an object of universal pity, embarked at Dover
with a numerous train, and from Boulogne, where she was received
by the duke of Angoulême, she was conducted to the
king, elated at the idea of marrying the handsomest princess in
Europe.</p>

<p>Among Mary's attendents was the youthful Anne Boleyn.
Her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, had been charged by Henry,
conjointly with the bishop of Ely, with the diplomatic negotiations
preliminary to this marriage. Anne had passed her childhood
at Hever Castle, surrounded by all that could heat the
imagination. Her maternal grandfather, the earl of Surrey,
whose eldest son had married the sister of Henry the Seventh's
queen, had filled, as did his sons also, the most important offices
of state. At the age probably of fourteen, when summoned
by her father to court, she wrote him the following letter in
French, which appears to refer to her departure for France:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I find by your letter that you wish me to appear at
court in a manner becoming a respectable female, and likewise
that the queen will condescend to enter into conversation with me;
at this I rejoice, as I do to think, that conversing with so sensible
and elegant a princess will make me even more desirous of
continuing to speak and to write good French; the more as it is
by your earnest advice, which (I acquaint you by this present
writing) I shall follow to the best of my ability.... As to
myself, rest assured that I shall not ungratefully look upon this
fatherly office as one that might be dispensed with; nor will it
tend to diminish my affection, quest [wish], and deliberation to
lead as holy a life as you may please to desire of me; indeed my
love for you is founded on so firm a basis that it can never be
impaired. I put an end to this my lucubration after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
very humbly craved your good will and affection. Written at
Hever, by</p>

</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">MARY MARRIES BRANDON.</div>

<p>Such were the feelings under which this young and interesting
lady, so calumniated by papistical writers, appeared at
court.</p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated at Abbeville on the 9th of
October 1514, and after a sumptuous banquet, the king of
France distributed his royal largesses among the English lords,
who were charmed by his courtesy. But the morrow was a
day of trial to the young queen. Louis XII had dismissed the
numerous train which had accompanied her, and even Lady
Guildford, to whom Henry had specially confided her. Three
only were left,&mdash;of whom the youthful Anne Boleyn was one.
At this separation, Mary gave way to the keenest sorrow. To
cheer her spirits, Louis proclaimed a grand tournament. Brandon
hastened to France at its first announcement, and carried
off all the prizes; while the king, languidly reclining on a couch,
could with difficulty look upon the brilliant spectacle over which
his queen presided, sick at heart yet radiant with youth and
beauty. Mary was unable to conceal her emotion, and Louisa
of Savoy, who was watching her, divined her secret. But Louis,
if he experienced the tortures of jealousy, did not feel them
long, for his death took place on the 1st January 1515.</p>

<p>Even before her husband's funeral was over, Mary's heart
beat high with hope. Francis I, impatient to see her wedded
to some unimportant political personage, encouraged her love
for Brandon. The latter, who had been commissioned by
Henry to convey to her his letters of condolence, feared his
master's anger if he should dare aspire to the hand of the
princess. But the widowed queen, who was resolved to brave
every thing, told her lover: "Either you marry me in four
days or you see me no more." The choice the king had made
of his ambassador announced that he would not behave very
harshly. The marriage was celebrated in the abbey of Clugny,
and Henry pardoned them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OXFORD.</div>

<p>While Mary returned to England, as Wolsey had predicted,
Anne Boleyn remained in France. Her father, desiring his
daughter to become an accomplished woman, intrusted her to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
care of the virtuous Claude of France, <i>the good queen</i>, at whose
court the daughters of the first families of the kingdom were
trained. Margaret, duchess of Alencon, the sister of Francis,
and afterwards queen of Navarre, often charmed the queen's
circle by her lively conversation. She soon became deeply attached
to the young Englishwoman, and on the death of Claude
took her into her own family. Anne Boleyn was destined at no
very remote period to be at the court of London a reflection of
the graceful Margaret, and her relations with that princess were
not without influence on the English Reformation.</p>

<p>And indeed the literary movement which had passed from
Italy into France appeared at that time as if it would cross from
France into Britain. Oxford exercises over England as great
an influence as the metropolis; and it is almost always within
its walls that a movement commences whether for good or evil.
At this period of our history, an enthusiastic youth hailed with
joy the first beams of the new sun, and attacked with their
sarcasms the idleness of the monks, the immorality of the
clergy, and the superstition of the people. Disgusted with the
priestcraft of the middle ages, and captivated by the writers of
antiquity and the purity of the Gospel, Oxford boldly called
for a reform which should burst the bonds of clerical domination
and emancipate the human mind. Men of letters thought for
a while that they had found the most powerful man in England
in Wolsey, the ally that would give them the victory.</p>

<p>He possessed little taste for learning, but seeing the wind of
public favour blow in that direction, he readily spread his sails
before it. He got the reputation of a profound divine, by quoting
a few words of Thomas Aquinas, and the fame of a
Mæcenas and Ptolemy, by inviting the learned to his gorgeous
entertainments. "O happy cardinal," exclaimed Erasmus, "who
can surround his table with such torches!"<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>At that time the king felt the same ambition as his minister,
and having tasted in turn the pleasures of war and diplomacy,
he now bent his mind to literature. He desired Wolsey to present
Sir Thomas More to him.&mdash;"What shall I do at court?"
replied the latter. "I shall be as awkward as a man that never
rode sitteth in a saddle." Happy in his family circle, where
his father, mother, and children, gathering round the same table,
formed a pleasing group, which the pencil of Holbein has transmitted
to us, More had no desire to leave it. But Henry was
not a man to put up with a refusal; he employed force almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to draw More from his retirement, and in a short time he could
not live without the society of the man of letters. On calm and
starlight nights they would walk together upon the leads at the
top of the palace, discoursing on the motions of the heavenly
bodies. If More did not appear at court, Henry would go to
Chelsea and share the frugal dinner of the family with some of
their simple neighbours. "Where," asked Erasmus, "where is the
Athens, the Porch, or the Academe, that can be compared with
the court of England?... It is a seat of the muses rather
than a palace.... The golden age is reviving, and I congratulate
the world."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONASTERIES ASSAILED.</div>

<p>But the friends of classical learning were not content with
the cardinal's banquets or the king's favours. They wanted
victories, and their keenest darts were aimed at the cloisters,
those strong fortresses of the hierarchy and of uncleanness.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
The abbot of Saint Albans, having taken a married woman for
his concubine, and placed her at the head of a nunnery, his
monks had followed his example, and indulged in the most scandalous
debauchery. Public indignation was so far aroused, that
Wolsey himself&mdash;Wolsey, the father of several illegitimate
children, and who was suffering the penalty of his irregularities<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>&mdash;was
carried away by the spirit of the age, and demanded of
the pope a general reform of manners. When they heard of
this request, the priests and friars were loud in their outcries.
"What are you about?" said they to Wolsey. "You are giving
the victory to the enemies of the church, and your only reward
will be the hatred of the whole world." As this was not the
cardinal's game, he abandoned his project, and conceived one
more easily executed. Wishing to deserve the name of "Ptolemy"
conferred on him by Erasmus, he undertook to build two large
colleges, one at Ipswich, his native town, the other at Oxford;
and found it convenient to take the money necessary for their
endowment, not from his own purse, but from the purses of the
monks. He pointed out to the pope twenty-two monasteries in
which (he said) vice and impiety had taken up their abode.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
The pope granted their secularization, and Wolsey having thus
procured a revenue of £2000 sterling, laid the foundations of
his college, traced out various courts, and constructed spacious
kitchens. He fell into disgrace before he had completed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
work, which led Gualter to say with a sneer: "He began a
college and built a cook's shop."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> But a great example had been
set: the monasteries had been attacked, and the first breach
made in them by a cardinal. Cromwell, Wolsey's secretary,
remarked how his master had set about his work, and in after-years
profited by the lesson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLET PREACHES THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>It was fortunate for letters that they had sincerer friends in
London than Wolsey. Of these were Colet, dean of St. Paul's,
whose house was the centre of the literary movement which
preceded the Reformation, and his friend and guest Erasmus.
The latter was the hardy pioneer who opened the road of antiquity
to modern Europe. One day he would entertain Colet's
guests with the account of a new manuscript; on another, with
a discussion on the forms of ancient literature; and at other
times he would attack the schoolmen and monks, when Colet
would take the same side. The only antagonist who dared
measure his strength with him was Sir Thomas More, who,
although a layman, stoutly defended the ordinances of the
church.</p>

<p>But mere table-talk could not satisfy the dean: a numerous
audience attended his sermons at St. Paul's. The spirituality
of Christ's words, the authority which characterizes them, their
admirable simplicity and mysterious depth, had deeply charmed
him: "I admire the writings of the apostles," he would say,
"but I forget them almost, when I contemplate the wonderful
majesty of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Setting aside the tests prescribed
by the church, he explained, like Zwingle, the Gospel of
St. Matthew. Nor did he stop here. Taking advantage of
the Convocation, he delivered a sermon on <i>conformation</i> and
<i>reformation</i>, which was one of the numerous forerunners of
the great reform of the sixteenth century. "We see strange
and heretical ideas appear in our days, and no wonder," said
he. "But you must know there is no heresy more dangerous
to the church than the vicious lives of its priests. A reformation
is needed; and that reformation must begin with the bishops
and be extended to the priests. The clergy once reformed, we
shall proceed to the reformation of the people."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Thus spoke
Colet, while the citizens of London listened to him with rapture,

Fitzjames, bishop of London, was a superstitious obstinate old
man of eighty, fond of money, excessively irritable, a poor theologian,
and a slave to Duns Scotus, the <i>subtle doctor</i>. Calling
to his aid two other bishops as zealous as himself for the preservation
of abuses, namely, Bricot and Standish, he denounced
the dean of St. Paul's to Warham. The archbishop having
inquired what he had done: "What has he done?" rejoined
the bishop of London. "He teaches that we must not worship
images; he translates the Lord's Prayer into English; he pretends
that the text <i>Feed my sheep</i>, does not include the temporal
supplies the clergy draw from their flock. And besides
all this," he continued with some embarrassment, "he has spoken
against those who carry their manuscripts into the pulpit and
read their sermons!" As this was the bishop's practice, the
primate could not refrain from smiling; and since Colet refused
to justify himself, Warham did so for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREEKS AND TROJANS.</div>

<p>From that time Colet laboured with fresh zeal to scatter the
darkness. He devoted the larger portion of his fortune to
found the celebrated school of St. Paul, of which the learned
Lilly was the first master. Two parties, the <i>Greeks</i> and the
<i>Trojans</i>, entered the lists, not to contend with sword and spear,
as in the ancient epic, but with the tongue, the pen, and sometimes
the fist. If the <i>Trojans</i> (the obscurants) were defeated
in the public disputations, they had their revenge in the secret
of the confessional. <i>Cave a Græcis ne fias hereticus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> was the
watchword of the priests&mdash;their daily lesson to the youths under
their care. They looked on the school founded by Colet
as the monstrous horse of the perjured Sinon, and announced
that from its bosom would inevitably issue the destruction of
the people. Colet and Erasmus replied to the monks by inflicting
fresh blows. Linacre, a thorough literary enthusiast,&mdash;Grocyn,
a man of sarcastic humour but generous heart,&mdash;and
many others, reinforced the <i>Grecian</i> phalanx. Henry himself
used to take one of them with him during his journeys, and if
any unlucky <i>Trojan</i> ventured in his presence to attack the
tongue of Plato and of Saint Paul, the young king would set
his Hellenian on him. Not more numerous were the contests
witnessed in times of yore on the classic banks of Xanthus and
Simois.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Wolsey&mdash;His first Commission&mdash;His complaisance and Dioceses&mdash;Cardinal,
Chancellor, and Legate&mdash;Ostentation and Necromancy&mdash;His
Spies and Enmity&mdash;Pretensions of the Clergy.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY.</div>

<p>Just as everything seemed tending to a reformation, a powerful
priest rendered the way more difficult.</p>

<p>One of the most striking personages of the age was then
making his appearance on the stage of the world. It was the
destiny of that man, in the reign of Henry VIII, to combine
extreme ability with extreme immorality; and to be a new and
striking example of the wholesome truth that immorality is
more effectual to destroy a man than ability to save him. Wolsey
was the last high-priest of Rome in England, and when his
fall startled the nation, it was the signal of a still more striking
fall&mdash;the fall of popery.</p>

<p>Thomas Wolsey, the son of a wealthy butcher of Ipswich,
according to the common story, which is sanctioned by high
authority, had attained under Henry VII the post of almoner,
at the recommendation of Sir Richard Nanfan, treasurer of
Calais and an old patron of his. But Wolsey was not at all
desirous of passing his life in saying mass. As soon as he had
discharged the regular duties of his office, instead of spending
the rest of the day in idleness, as his colleagues did, he strove
to win the good graces of the persons round the king.</p>

<p>Fox, Bishop of Winchester, keeper of the privy-seal under
Henry VII, uneasy at the growing power of the earl of Surrey,
looked about for a man to counterbalance them. He thought
he had found such a one in Wolsey. It was to oppose the
Surreys, the grandfather and uncles of Anne Boleyn, that the
son of the Ipswich butcher was drawn from his obscurity. This
is not an unimportant circumstance in our narrative. Fox
began to praise Wolsey in the king's hearing, and at the same
time he encouraged the almoner to give himself to public affairs.
The latter was not deaf,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and soon found an opportunity of
winning his sovereign's favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FIRST SERVICES UNDER HENRY VII.</div>

<p>The king having business of importance with the emperor,
who was then in Flanders, sent for Wolsey, explained his wishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and ordered him to prepare to set out. The chaplain determined
to show Henry VII how capable he was of serving him.
It was long past noon when he took leave of the king at Richmond&mdash;at
four o'clock he was in London, at seven at Gravesend.
By travelling all night he reached Dover just as the
packet-boat was about to sail. After a passage of three hours
he reached Calais, whence he travelled post, and the same evening
appeared before Maximilian. Having obtained what he
desired, he set off again by night, and on the next day but one
reached Richmond, three days and some few hours after his
departure. The king, catching sight of him just as he was going
to mass, sharply inquired, why he had not set out. "Sire,
I am just returned," answered Wolsey, placing the emperor's
letters in his master's hands. Henry was delighted, and Wolsey
saw that his fortune was made.</p>

<p>The courtiers hoped at first that Wolsey, like an inexperienced
pilot, would run his vessel on some hidden rock; but never did
helmsman manage his ship with more skill. Although twenty
years older than Henry VIII the almoner danced, and sang,
and laughed with the prince's companions, and amused his new
master with tales of scandal and quotations from Thomas
Aquinas. The young king found his house a temple of paganism,
a shrine of voluptuousness;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and while Henry's councillors
were entreating him to leave his pleasures and attend to business,
Wolsey was continually reminding him that he ought to
devote his youth to learning and amusement, and leave the toils
of government to others. Wolsey was created bishop of Tournay
during the campaign in Flanders, and on his return to England,
was raised to the sees of Lincoln and of York. Three
mitres had been placed on his head in one year. He found at
last the vein he so ardently sought for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OSTENTATION AND NECROMANCY.</div>

<p>And yet he was not satisfied. The archbishop of Canterbury
had insisted, as primate, that the cross of York should be lowered
to his. Wolsey was not of a disposition to concede this,
and when he found that Warham was not content with being
his equal, he resolved to make him his inferior. He wrote to
Paris and to Rome. Francis I, who desired to conciliate England,
demanded the purple for Wolsey, and the archbishop of
York received the title of Cardinal St. Cecilia beyond the Tiber.
In November 1515, his hat was brought by the envoy of the
pope: "It would have been better to have given him a Tyburn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tippet," said some indignant Englishmen; "these Romish hats
never brought good into England"<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>&mdash;a saying that has become
proverbial.</p>

<p>This was not enough for Wolsey: he desired secular greatness
above all things. Warham, tired of contending with so arrogant
a rival, resigned the seals, and the king immediately transferred
them to the cardinal. At length a bull appointed him
legate <i>a latere</i> of the holy see, and placed under his jurisdiction
all the colleges, monasteries, spiritual courts, bishops, and the
primate himself (1519). From that time, as lord-chancellor of
England and legate, Wolsey administered every thing in church
and state. He filled his coffers with money procured both at
home and from abroad, and yielded without restraint to his
dominant vices, ostentation and pride. Whenever he appeared
in public, two priests, the tallest and comeliest that could be
found, carried before him two huge silver crosses, one to mark
his dignity as archbishop, the other as papal legate. Chamberlains,
gentlemen, pages, sergeants, chaplains, choristers, clerks,
cupbearers, cooks, and other domestics, to the number of more
than 500, among whom were nine or ten lords and the stateliest
yeomen of the country, filled his palace. He generally wore a
dress of scarlet velvet and silk, with hat and gloves of the same
colour. His shoes were embroidered with gold and silver, inlaid
with pearls and precious stones. A kind of papacy was
thus forming in England; for wherever pride flourishes there
popery is developed.</p>

<p>One thing occupied Wolsey more than all the pomp with
which he was surrounded: his desire, namely, to captivate the
king. For this purpose he cast Henry's nativity, and procured
an amulet which he wore constantly, in order to charm his
master by its magic properties.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Then having recourse to a
still more effectual necromancy, he selected from among the
licentious companions of the young monarch those of the keenest
discernment and most ambitious character; and after binding
them to him by a solemn oath, he placed them at court to be
as eyes and ears to him. Accordingly not a word was said in
the presence of the monarch, particularly against Wolsey, of
which he was not informed an hour afterwards. If the culprit
was not in favour, he was expelled without mercy; in the contrary
case, the minister sent him on some distant mission. The
queen's ladies, the king's chaplains, and even their confessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were the cardinal's spies. He pretended to omnipresence, as
the pope to infallibility.</p>

<p>Wolsey was not devoid of certain showy virtues, for he was
liberal to the poor even to affectation, and as chancellor inexorable
to every kind of irregularity, and strove particularly to
make the rich and high-born bend beneath his power. Men of
learning alone obtained from him some little attention, and
hence Erasmus calls him "the Achates of a new Æneas." But
the nation was not to be carried away by the eulogies of a few
scholars. Wolsey&mdash;a man of more than suspected morals,
double-hearted, faithless to his promises, oppressing the people
with heavy taxes, and exceedingly arrogant to every body&mdash;Wolsey
soon became hated by the people of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CLAIM OF THE CLERGY.</div>

<p>The elevation of a prince of the Roman church could not be
favourable to the Reformation. The priests, encouraged by it,
determined to make a stand against the triple attack of the
learned, the reformers, and the state; and they soon had an
opportunity of trying their strength. Holy orders had become
during the middle ages a warrant for every sort of crime. Parliament,
desirous of correcting this abuse and checking the encroachments
of the church, declared in the year 1513 that any
ecclesiastic, accused of theft or murder, should be tried before
the secular tribunals. Exceptions, however, were made in favour
of bishops, priests, and deacons&mdash;that is to say, nearly all the
clergy. Notwithstanding this timid precaution, an insolent
clerk, the abbot of Winchelcomb, began the battle by exclaiming
at St. Paul's: "<i>Touch not mine anointed</i>, said the Lord."
At the same time Wolsey, accompanied by a long train of priests
and prelates, had an audience of the king, at which he said with
hands upraised to heaven: "Sire, to try a clerk, is a violation of
God's laws." This time, however, Henry did not give way.
"By God's will, we are king of England," he replied, "and the
kings of England in times past had never any superior but God
only. Therefore know you well that we will maintain the right
of our crown." He saw distinctly that to put the clergy above
the laws was to put them above the throne. The priests were
beaten, but not disheartened: perseverance is a characteristic
feature of every hierarchical order. Not walking by faith, they
walk all the more by sight; and skilful combinations supply the
place of the holy aspirations of the Christian. Humble disciples
of the Gospel were soon to experience this, for the clergy
by a few isolated attacks were about to flesh themselves for the
great struggles of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WOLVES&mdash;RICHARD HUN.</div>

<p>It is occasionally necessary to soften down the somewhat exaggerated
colours in which contemporary writers describe the
Romish clergy; but there are certain appellations which history
is bound to accept. The <i>wolves</i>, for so the priests were called,
by attacking the Lords and Commons had attempted a work
beyond their reach. They turned their wrath on others. There
were many shepherds endeavouring to gather together the sheep
of the Lord beside the peaceful waters: these must be frightened,
and the sheep driven into the howling wilderness. "The
wolves" determined to fall upon the Lollards.</p>

<p>There lived in London an honest tradesman named Richard
Hun, one of those witnesses of the truth who, sincere though
unenlightened, have often been found in the bosom of Catholicism.
It was his practice to retire to his closet and spend a
portion of each day in the study of the Bible. At the death of
one of his children, the priest required of him an exorbitant fee,
which Hun refused to pay, and for which he was summoned
before the legate's court. Animated by that public spirit,
which characterizes the people of England, he felt indignant
that an Englishman should be cited before a foreign tribunal,
and laid an information against the priest and his counsel under
the act of <i>præmunire</i>. Such boldness&mdash;most extraordinary at
that time&mdash;exasperated the clergy beyond all bounds. "If
these proud citizens are allowed to have their way," exclaimed
the monks, "every layman will dare to resist a priest."</p>

<div class="sidenote">RICHARD HUN'S MURDER.</div>

<p>Exertions were accordingly made to snare the pretended
rebel in the trap of heresy;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> he was thrown into the Lollards'
tower at St. Paul's, and an iron collar was fastened round his
neck, attached to which was a chain so heavy that neither man
nor beast (says Foxe) would have been able to bear it long.
When taken before his judges, they could not convict him of
heresy, and it was observed with astonishment "that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his beads in prison with him."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> They would have set him at
liberty, after inflicting on him perhaps some trifling penance&mdash;but
then, what a bad example it would be, and who could stop
the reformers, if it was so easy to resist the papacy? Unable
to triumph by justice, certain fanatics resolved to triumph by
crime.</p>

<p>At midnight on the 2nd December&mdash;the day of his examination&mdash;three
men stealthily ascended the stairs of the Lollards'
tower: the bellringer went first carrying a torch; a sergeant
named Charles Joseph followed, and last came the bishop's
chancellor. Having entered the cell, they went up to the bed
on which Hun was lying, and finding that he was asleep, the
chancellor said: "Lay hands on the thief." Charles Joseph
and the bellringer fell upon the prisoner, who, awaking with a
start, saw at a glance what this midnight visit meant. He resisted
the assassins at first, but was soon overpowered and
strangled. Charles Joseph then fixed the dead man's belt round
his neck, the bellringer helped to raise his lifeless body, and the
chancellor slipped the other end of the belt through a ring fixed
in the wall. They then placed his cap on his head, and hastily
quitted the cell.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Immediately after, the conscience-stricken
Charles Joseph got on horseback and rode from the city; the
bellringer left the cathedral and hid himself: the crime dispersed
the criminals. The chancellor alone kept his ground, and he
was at prayers when the news was brought him that the turnkey
had found Hun hanging. "He must have killed himself
in despair," said the hypocrite. But every one knew poor Hun's
Christian feelings. "It is the priests who have murdered him,"
was the general cry in London, and an inquest was ordered to
be held on his body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUN CONDEMNED.</div>

<p>On Tuesday, the 5th of December, William Barnwell the
city coroner, the two sheriffs, and twenty-four jurymen, proceeded
to the Lollards' tower. They remarked that the belt
was so short that the head could not be got out of it, and that
consequently it had never been placed in it voluntarily, and
hence the jury concluded that the suspension was an after-thought
of some other persons. Moreover they found that the
ring was too high for the poor victim to reach it,&mdash;that the
body bore marks of violence&mdash;and that traces of blood were to
be seen in the cell: "Wherefore all we find by God and all our
consciences (runs the verdict), that Richard Hun was murdered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Also we acquit the said Richard Hun of his own
death."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>It was but too true, and the criminals themselves confessed
it. The miserable Charles Joseph having returned home on the
evening of the 6th December, said to his maid-servant: "If you
will swear to keep my secret, I will tell you all."&mdash;"Yes, master,"
she replied, "if it is neither felony nor treason."&mdash;Joseph
took a book, swore the girl on it, and then said to her: "I have
killed Richard Hun!"&mdash;"O master! how? he was called a worthy
man."&mdash;"I would lever [rather] than a hundred pounds it
were not done," he made answer; "but what is done cannot be
undone." He then rushed out of the house.</p>

<p>The clergy foresaw what a serious blow this unhappy affair
would be to them, and to justify themselves they examined
Hun's Bible (it was Wickliffe's version), and having read in the
preface that "poor men and idiots [simple folks] have the truth
of the holy Scriptures more than a thousand prelates and religious
men and clerks of the school," and further, that "the pope
ought to be called Antichrist," the bishop of London, assisted
by the bishops of Durham and Lincoln, declared Hun guilty of
heresy, and on the 20th December his dead body was burnt at
Smithfield. "Hun's bone's have been burnt, and therefore he
was a heretic," said the priests; "he was a heretic, and therefore
he committed suicide."</p>

<p>The triumph of the clergy was of short duration; for almost
at same time William Horsey, the bishop's chancellor,
Charles Joseph, and John Spalding the bellringer, were convicted
of the murder. A bill passed the Commons restoring Hun's
property to his family and vindicating his character; the Lords
accepted the bill, and the king himself said to the priests: "Restore
to these wretched children the property of their father
whom you so cruelly murdered to our great and just horror."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>&mdash;"If
the clerical theocracy should gain the mastery of the
state," was the general remark in London, "it would not only
be a very great lie, but the most frightful tyranny!" England
has never gone back since that time, and a theocratic rule has
always inspired the sound portion of the nation with a just and
insurmountable antipathy. Such were the events taking place
in England shortly before the Reformation. This was not
all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRAVESEND BOAT.</div>

<p>The clergy had not been fortunate in Hun's affair, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
they were not for that reason unwilling to attempt a new
one.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1517&mdash;the year in which Luther posted up
his <i>theses</i>&mdash;a priest, whose manners announced a man swollen
with pride, happened to be on board the passage-boat from
London to Gravesend with an intelligent and pious Christian of
Ashford, by name John Brown. The passengers, as they floated
down the stream, were amusing themselves by watching the
banks glide away from them, when the priest, turning towards
Brown, said to him insolently: "You are too near me, get farther
off. Do you know who I am?"&mdash;"No, sir," answered
Brown.&mdash;"Well, then, you must know that I am a priest."&mdash;"Indeed,
sir; are you a parson, or vicar, or a lady's chaplain?"&mdash;"No;
I am a <i>soul-priest</i>," he haughtily replied; "I sing mass
to save souls."&mdash;"Do you, sir," rejoined Brown somewhat ironically,
"that is well done; and can you tell me where you find
the soul when you begin the mass?"&mdash;"I cannot," said the
priest.&mdash;"And where you leave it when the mass is ended?"&mdash;"I
do not know."&mdash;"What!" continued Brown with marks of
astonishment, "you do not know where you find the soul or
where you leave it ... and yet you say that you save
it!"&mdash;"Go thy ways," said the priest angrily, "thou art a heretic,
and I will be even with thee." Thenceforward the priest
and his neighbour conversed no more together. At last they
reached Gravesend, and the boat anchored.</p>

<p>As soon as the priest had landed, he hastened to two of his
friends, Walter and William More, and all three mounting their
horses, set off for Canterbury, and denounced Brown to the
archbishop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BROWN PUT TO THE TORTURE.</div>

<p>In the meantime John Brown had reached home. Three days
later, his wife, Elizabeth, who had just left her chamber, went
to church, dressed all in white, to return thanks to God for
delivering her in the perils of childbirth. Her husband, assisted
by her daughter Alice and the maid-servant, were preparing for
their friends the feast usual on such occasions, and they had
all of them taken their seats at table, joy beaming on every
face, when the street-door was abruptly opened, and Chilton,
the constable, a cruel and savage man, accompanied by several
of the archbishop's apparitors, seized upon the worthy townsman.
All sprang from their seats in alarm; Elizabeth and Alice uttered
the most heart-rending cries; but the primate's officers, without
showing any emotion, pulled Brown out of the house, and
placed him on horseback, tying his feet under the animal's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
belly.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> It is a serious matter to jest with a priest. The cavalcade
rode off quickly, and Brown was thrown into prison, and
there left forty days.</p>

<p>At the end of this time, the archbishop of Canterbury and
the bishop of Rochester called before them the impudent fellow
who doubted whether a priest's mass could save souls, and required
him to retract this "blasphemy." But Brown, if he did
not believe in the mass, believed in the Gospel: "Christ was
once offered," he said, "to take away the sins of many. It is
by this sacrifice we are saved, and not by the repetitions of the
priests." At this reply the archbishop made a sign to the executioners,
one of whom took off the shoes and stockings of this
pious Christian, while the other brought in a pan of burning
coals, upon which they set the martyr's feet.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The English
laws in truth forbade torture to be inflicted on any subject of
the crown, but the clergy thought themselves above the laws.
"Confess the efficacity of the mass," cried the two bishops to
poor Brown. "If I deny my Lord upon earth," he replied,
"He will deny me before his Father in heaven." The flesh was
burnt off the soles of the feet even to the bones, and still John
Brown remained unshaken. The bishops therefore ordered
him to be given over to the secular arm that he might be burnt
alive.</p>

<p>On the Saturday preceding the festival of Pentecost, in the
year 1517, the martyr was led back to Ashford, where he arrived
just as the day was drawing to a close. A number of idle
persons were collected in the street, and among them was
Brown's maid-servant, who ran off crying to the house, and told
her mistress: "I have seen him!... He was bound, and they
were taking him to prison."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Elizabeth hastened to her husband
and found him sitting with his feet in the stocks, his features
changed by suffering, and expecting to be burnt alive on
the morrow. The poor woman sat down beside him, weeping
most bitterly, while he, being hindered by his chains, could not
so much as bend towards her. "I cannot set my feet to the
ground," said he, "for bishops have burnt them to the bones;
but they could not burn my tongue and prevent my confessing
the Lord.... O Elizabeth! ... continue to love him for He
is good; and bring up our children in his fear."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>On the following morning&mdash;it was Whitsunday&mdash;the brutal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Chilton and his assistants led Brown to the place of execution,
and fastened him to the stake. Elizabeth and Alice, with his
other children and his friends, desirous of receiving his last sigh,
surrounded the pile, uttering cries of anguish. The fagots were
set on fire, while Brown, calm and collected, and full of confidence
in the blood of the Saviour, clasped his hands, and repeated
this hymn, which Foxe has preserved:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>The martyr was silent: the flames had consumed their victim.
Then redoubled cries of anguish rent the air. His wife and

showed them the tenderest compassion, and turned with
a movement of indignation towards the executioners. The

day spring from their father's ashes."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> He rushed towards
Alice, and was about to lay hold of her, when the maiden
shrank back screaming with horror. To the end of her life,
she recollected the fearful moment, and to her we are indebted
for the particulars. The fury of the monster was checked.
Such were the scenes passing in England shortly before the
Reformation.</p>

<p>The priests were not yet satisfied, for the scholars still remained
in England: if they could not be burnt, they should at least be
banished. They set to work accordingly. Standish, bishop of
St. Asaph, a sincere man, as it would seem, but fanatical, was
inveterate in his hatred of Erasmus, who had irritated him by an
idle sarcasm. When speaking of <i>St. Asaph's</i> it was very common
to abbreviate it into <i>St. As's</i>; and as Standish was a theologian of
no great learning, Erasmus, in his jesting way, would sometimes
call him <i>Episcopus a Sancto Asino</i>. As the bishop could not
destroy Colet, the disciple, he flattered himself that he should
triumph over the master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1516 and 1517.</div>

<p>Erasmus knew Standish's intentions. Should he commence
in England that struggle with the papacy which Luther was
about to begin in Germany? It was no longer possible to steer
a middle course: he must either fight or leave. The Dutchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was faithful to his nature&mdash;we may even say, to his vocation:
he left the country.</p>

<p>Erasmus was, in his time, the head of the great literary
community. By means of his connexions and his correspondence,
which extended over all Europe, he established between those
countries where learning was reviving, an interchange of ideas
and manuscripts. The pioneer of antiquity, an eminent critic,
a witty satirist, the advocate of correct taste, and a restorer of
literature, one only glory was wanting: he had not the creative
spirit, the heroic soul of a Luther. He calculated with no little
skill, could detect the smile on the lips or the knitting of the
brows; but he had not that self-abandonment, that enthusiasm
for the truth, that firm confidence in God, without which nothing
great can be done in the world, and least of all in the
church. "Erasmus <i>had</i> much, but <i>was</i> little," said one of his
biographers.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1517 a crisis had arrived: the period of the revival
was over, that of the Reformation was beginning. The
restoration of letters was succeeded by the regeneration of religion:
the days of criticism and neutrality by those of courage
and action. Erasmus was then only forty-nine years old; but
he had finished his career. From being first, he must now be
second: the monk of Wittemberg dethroned him. He looked
around himself in vain: placed in a new country, he had lost his
road. A hero was needed to inaugurate the great movement of
modern times: Erasmus was a mere man of letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS GOES TO BASLE.</div>

<p>When attacked by Standish in 1516, the literary king determined
to quit the court of England, and take refuge in a printing-office.
But before laying down his sceptre at the foot of a
Saxon monk, he signalized the end of his reign by the most
brilliant of his publications. The epoch of 1516-17, memorable
for the theses of Luther, was destined to be equally remarkable
by a work which was to imprint on the new times their essential
character. What distinguishes the Reformation from all anterior
revivals is the union of learning with piety, and a faith
more profound, more enlightened, and based on the word of God.
The Christian people was then emancipated from the tutelage of
the schools and the popes, and its charter of enfranchisement was
the Bible. The sixteenth century did more than its predecessors:
it went straight to the fountain (the Holy Scriptures), cleared
it of weeds and brambles, plumbed its depths, and caused its
abundant streams to pour forth on all around. The Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
age studied the Greek Testament, which the clerical age had almost
forgotten,&mdash;and this is its greatest glory. Now the first
explorer of this divine source was Erasmus. When attacked by
the hierarchy, the leader of the schools withdrew from the
splendid halls of Henry VIII. It seemed to him that the new
era which he had announced to the world was rudely interrupted:
he could do nothing more by his conversation for the country of
the Tudors. But he carried with him those precious leaves,
the fruit of his labours&mdash;a book which would do more than he
desired. He hastened to Basle, and took up his quarters in
Frobenius's printing-office,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> where he not only laboured himself,
but made others labour. England will soon receive the seed of
the new life, and the Reformation is about to begin.</p>

<p>It was within the province of four powers in the sixteenth
century to effect a reformation of the church: these were the
papacy, the episcopate, the monarchy, and Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>The Reformation in England was essentially the work of
Scripture.</p>

<p>The only true reformation is that which emanates from the
word of God. The Holy Scriptures, by bearing witness to the
incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Son of God, create in
man by the Holy Ghost a faith which justifies him. That faith
which produces in him a new life, unites him to Christ, without
his requiring a chain of bishops or a Roman mediator, who would
separate him from the Saviour instead of drawing him nearer.
This Reformation <i>by the word</i> restores that spiritual Christianity
which the outward and hierarchical religion had destroyed; and
from the regeneration of individuals naturally results the regeneration
of the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORMATION, NOT ROYAL.</div>

<p>The Reformation of England, perhaps to a greater extent
than that of the continent, was effected by the word of God.
This statement may appear paradoxical, but it is not the less
true. Those great individualities we meet with in Germany,
Switzerland, and France&mdash;men like Luther, Zwingle, and Calvin&mdash;do
not appear in England; but Holy Scripture is widely
circulated. What brought light into the British isles subsequently
to the year 1517, and on a more extended scale after
the year 1526, was the word&mdash;the invisible power of the invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
God. The religion of the anglo-Saxon race&mdash;a race called
more than any other to circulate the oracles of God throughout
the world&mdash;is particularly distinguished by its biblical character.</p>

<p>The Reformation of England could not be papal. No reform
can be hoped from that which ought to be not only reformed but
abolished; and besides, no monarch dethrones himself. We may
even affirm that the popedom has always felt a peculiar affection
for its conquests in Britain, and that they would have been the
last it would have renounced. A serious voice had declared in
the middle of the fifteenth century: "A reform is neither in
the will nor in the power of the popes."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>The Reformation of England was not episcopal. Roman
hierarchism will never be abolished by Roman bishops. An
episcopal assembly may perhaps, as at Constance, depose three
competing popes, but then it will be to save the papacy. And
if the bishops could not abolish the papacy, still less could they
reform themselves. The then existing episcopal power being
at enmity with the word of God, and the slave of its own abuses,
was incapable of renovating the church. On the contrary, it exerted
all its influence to prevent such a renovation.</p>

<p>The Reformation in England was not royal. Samuel, David,
and Josiah were able to do something for the raising up of the
church, when God again turned his face towards it; but a king
cannot rob his people of their religion, and still less can he
give them one. It has often been repeated that "the English
Reformation derives its origin from the monarch;" but the assertion
is incorrect. The work of God, here as elsewhere, cannot
be put in comparison with the work of the king; and if the
latter was infinitely surpassed in importance, it was also preceded
in time by many years. The monarch was still keeping up a
vigorous resistance behind his intrenchments, when God had already
decided the victory along the whole line of operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO PARTIES IN THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>Shall we be told that a reform effected by any other principle
than the established authorities, both in <i>church</i> and <i>state</i>, would
have been a revolution? But has God, the lawful sovereign of
the church, forbidden all revolution in a sinful world? A <i>revolution</i>
is not a revolt. The fall of the first man was a great
revolution: the restoration of man by Jesus Christ was a counter-revolution.
The corruption occasioned by popery was allied to
the fall: the reformation accomplished in the sixteenth century
was connected therefore with the restoration. There will no
doubt be other interventions of the Deity, which will be revolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in the same direction as the Reformation. When
God creates a new heaven and a new earth, will not that be one
of the most glorious of revolutions? The Reformation by the
word alone gives truth, alone gives unity; but more than that, it
alone bears the marks of true <i>legitimacy</i>; for the church belongs
not unto men, even though they be priests. God alone is its
lawful sovereign.</p>

<p>And yet the human elements which we have enumerated
were not wholly foreign to the work that was accomplishing in
England. Besides the word of God, other principles were in
operation, and although less radical and less primitive, they still
retain the sympathy of eminent men of that nation.</p>

<p>And in the first place, the intervention of the king's authority
was necessary to a certain point. Since the supremacy of Rome
had been established in England by several usages which had
the force of law, the intervention of the temporal power was
necessary to break the bonds which it had previously sanctioned.
But it was requisite for the monarchy, while adopting a negative
and political action, to leave the positive, doctrinal, and creative
action to the word of God.</p>

<p>Besides the Reformation <i>in the name of the Scriptures</i>, there
was then in England another <i>in the name of the king</i>. The word
of God began, the kingly power followed; and ever since, these
two forces have sometimes gone together against the authority
of the Roman pontiffs&mdash;sometimes in opposition to each other,
like those troops which march side by side in the same army,
against the same enemy, and which have occasionally been seen,
even on the field of battle, to turn their swords against each other.</p>

<p>Finally, the episcopate, which had begun by opposing the Reformation,
was compelled to accept it in despite of its convictions.
The majority of the bishops were opposed to it; but the better
portion were found to incline, some to the side of outward reform,
of which separation from the papacy was the very essence,
and others to the side of internal reform, whose mainspring was
union with Jesus Christ. Lastly, the episcopate took up its
ground on its own account, and soon two great parties alone
existed in England: the scriptural party and the clerical party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLITICAL EVENTS.</div>

<p>These two parties have survived even to our days, and their
colours are still distinguishable in the river of the church, like
the muddy Arve and the limpid Rhone after their confluence.
The royal supremacy, from which many Christians, preferring
the paths of independence, have withdrawn since the end of the
16th century, is recognised by both parties in the establishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with some few exceptions. But whilst the High Church is
essentially hierarchical, the Low Church is essentially biblical.
In the one, the Church is above and the word below; in the
other, the Church is below and the Word above. These two
principles, evangelism and hierarchism, are found in the Christianity
of the first centuries, but with a signal difference.
Hierarchism then almost entirely effaced evangelism; in the age
of protestantism, on the contrary, evangelism continued to exist
by the side of hierarchism, and it has remained <i>de jure</i>, if not
always <i>de facto</i>, the only legitimate opinion of the church.</p>

<p>Thus there is in England a complication of influences and contests,
which render the Work more difficult to describe; but it is
on that very account more worthy the attention of the philosopher
and the Christian.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Great events had just occurred in Europe. Francis I had
crossed the Alps, gained a signal victory at Marignano, and
conquered the north of Italy. The affrighted Maximilian knew
of none who could save him but Henry VIII. "I will adopt
you; you shall be my successor in the empire," he intimated to
him in May 1516. "Your army shall invade France; and then
we will march together to Rome, where the sovereign pontiff
shall crown you king of the Romans." The king of France,
anxious to effect a diversion, had formed a league with Denmark
and Scotland, and had made preparations for invading England
to place on the throne the "white rose,"&mdash;the pretender Pole,
heir to the claims of the house of York.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Henry now showed
his prudence; he declined Maximilian's offer, and turned his
whole attention to the security of his kingdom. But while he
refused to bear arms in France and Italy, a war of quite another
kind broke out in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</div>

<p>The great work of the 16th century was about to begin. A
volume fresh from the presses of Basle had just crossed the
Channel. Being transmitted to London, Oxford, and Cambridge,
this book, the fruit of Erasmus's vigils, soon found its way
wherever there were friends of learning. It was the <i>New Testament</i>
of our Lord Jesus Christ, published for the first time in
Greek with a new Latin translation&mdash;an event more important
for the world than would have been the landing of the pretender
in England, or the appearance of the chief of the Tudors in
Italy. This book, in which God has deposited for man's salvation
the seeds of life, was about to effect alone, without patrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and without interpreters, the most astonishing revolution in
Britain.</p>

<p>When Erasmus published this work, at the dawn, so to say,
of modern times, he did not see all its scope. Had he foreseen
it, he would perhaps have recoiled in alarm. He saw indeed
that there was a great work to be done, but he believed that all
good men would unite to do it with common accord. "A
spiritual temple must be raised in desolated Christendom," said
he. "The mighty of this world will contribute towards it their
marble, their ivory, and their gold; I who am poor and humble
offer the foundation stone," and he laid down before the world
his edition of the Greek Testament. Then glancing disdainfully
at the traditions of men, he said: "It is not from human reservoirs,
fetid with stagnant waters, that we should draw the
doctrine of salvation; but from the pure and abundant streams
that flow from the heart of God." And when some of his suspicious
friends spoke to him of the difficulties of the times, he
replied: "If the ship of the church is to be saved from being
swallowed up by the tempest, there is only one anchor that can
save it: it is the heavenly word, which, issuing from the bosom
of the Father, lives, speaks, and works still in the Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
These noble sentiments served as an introduction to those blessed
pages which were to reform England. Erasmus, like Caiaphas,
prophesied without being aware of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEMAND OF ERASMUS.</div>

<p>The New Testament in Greek and Latin had hardly appeared
when it was received by all men of upright mind with unprecedented
enthusiasm. Never had any book produced such a
sensation. It was in every hand: men struggled to procure it,
read it eagerly, and would even kiss it.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The words it contained
enlightened every heart. But a reaction soon took place.
Traditional catholicism uttered a cry from the depths of its
noisome pools, (to use Erasmus's figure). Franciscans and Dominicans,
priests and bishops, not daring to attack the educated
and well-born, went among the ignorant populace, and endeavoured
by their tales and clamours to stir up susceptible women
and credulous men. "Here are horrible heresies," they exclaimed,
"here are frightful antichrists! If this book be tolerated
it will be the death of the papacy!"&mdash;"We must drive this man
from the university," said one. "We must turn him out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
church," added another. "The public places re-echoed with
their howlings," said Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The firebrands tossed by their
furious hands were raising fires in every quarter; and the flames
kindled in a few obscure convents threatened to spread over the
whole country.</p>

<p>This irritation was not without a cause. The book, indeed,
contained nothing but Latin and Greek; but this first step seemed
to augur another&mdash;the translation of the Bible into the vulgar
tongue. Erasmus loudly called for it.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> "Perhaps it may be
necessary to conceal the secrets of kings," he remarked, "but
we must publish the mysteries of Christ. The Holy Scriptures,
translated into all languages, should be read not only by the
Scotch and Irish, but even by Turks and Saracens. The husbandman
should sing them as he holds the handle of his plough,
the weaver repeat them as he plies his shuttle, and the wearied
traveller, halting on his journey, refresh him under some shady
tree by these godly narratives." These words prefigured a
golden age after the iron age of popery. A number of Christian
families in Britain and on the continent were soon to
realize these evangelical forebodings, and England after three
centuries was to endeavour to carry them out for the benefit of
all the nations on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>The priests saw the danger, and by a skilful man&oelig;uvre, instead
of finding fault with the Greek Testament, attacked the
translation and the translator. "He has corrected the Vulgate,"
they said, "and puts himself in the place of Saint Jerome. He
sets aside a work authorized by the consent of ages and inspired
by the Holy Ghost. What audacity!" And then, turning over
the pages, they pointed out the most odious passages: "Look
here! this book calls upon men to <i>repent</i>, instead of requiring
them, as the Vulgate does, <i>to do penance</i>!" (Matt. iv. 17.) The
priests thundered against him from their pulpits:<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> "This man
has committed the unpardonable sin," they asserted; "for he
maintains that there is nothing in common between the Holy
Ghost and the monks&mdash;that they are logs rather than men!"
These simple remarks were received with a general laugh; but
the priests, in no wise disconcerted, cried out all the louder:
"He's a heretic, an heresiarch, a forger! he's a goose<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> ...
what do I say? he's a very antichrist!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIEST'S ATTACK AT COURT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>It was not sufficient for the papal janissaries to make war in
the plain, they must carry it to the higher ground. Was not
the king a friend of Erasmus? If he should declare himself a
patron of the Greek and Latin Testament, what an awful calamity!...
After having agitated the cloisters, towns, and
universities, they resolved to protest against it boldly, even in
Henry's presence. They thought: "If he is won, all is won."
It happened one day that a certain theologian (whose name is
not given) having to preach in his turn before the king, he
declaimed violently against the <i>Greek</i> language and its new interpreters.
Pace, the king's secretary, was present, and turning
his eyes on Henry, observed him smiling good humouredly.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
On leaving the church, every one began to exclaim against the
preacher. "Bring the priest to me," said the king; and then
turning to More, he added: "You shall defend the Greek cause
against him, and I will listen to the disputation." The literary
tribunal was soon formed, but the sovereign's order had taken
away all the priest's courage. He came forward trembling, fell
on his knees, and with clasped hands exclaimed: "I know not
what spirit impelled me." "A spirit of madness," said the king,
"and not the spirit of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> He then added: "Have
you ever read Erasmus?" "No, Sire." "Away with you then,
you are a blockhead." "And yet," said the preacher in confusion,
"I remember to have read something about <i>Moria</i>,"
(Erasmus's treatise on <i>Folly</i>).&mdash;"A subject, your majesty, that
ought to be very familiar to him," wickedly interrupted Pace.
The <i>obscurant</i> could say nothing in his justification. "I am
not altogether opposed to the Greek," he added at last, "seeing
that it is derived from the Hebrew."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> This was greeted with
a general laugh, and the king impatiently ordered the monk to
leave the room, and never appear before him again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LABOURS OF ERASMUS.</div>

<p>Erasmus was astonished at these discussions. He had imagined
the season to be most favourable. "Every thing looks
peaceful," he had said to himself; "now is the time to launch
my Greek Testament into the learned world."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> As well
might the sun rise upon the earth, and no one see it! At
that very hour God was raising up a monk at Wittemberg
who would lift the trumpet to his lips, and proclaim the
new day. "Wretch that I am!" exclaimed the timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
scholar, beating his breast, "who could have forseen this horrible
tempest!"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Nothing was more important at the dawn of the Reformation
than the publication of the Testament of Jesus Christ in the
original language. Never had Erasmus worked so carefully.
"If I told what sweat it cost me, no one would believe me."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
He had collated many Greek MSS. of the New Testament,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
and was surrounded by all the commentaries and translations,
by the writings of Origen, Cyprian, Ambrose, Basil, Chrysostom,
Cyril, Jerome, and Augustine. <i>Hic sum in campo meo!</i> he exclaimed
as he sat in the midst of his books. He had investigated
the texts according to the principles of sacred criticism.
When a knowledge of Hebrew was necessary, he had consulted
Capito and more particularly &OElig;colampadius. <i>Nothing without
Theseus</i>, said he of the latter, making use of a Greek proverb.
He had corrected the amphibologies, obscurities, hebraisms, and
barbarisms of the Vulgate; and had caused a list to be printed
of the errors in that version.</p>

<p>"We must restore the pure text of the word of God," he
had said; and when he heard the maledictions of the priests, he
had exclaimed: "I call God to witness I thought I was doing a
work acceptable to the Lord and necessary to the cause of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Nor in this was he deceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDWARD LEE.</div>

<p>At the head of his adversaries was Edward Lee, successively
king's almoner, archdeacon of Colchester, and archbishop of
York. Lee, at that time but little known, was a man of talent
and activity, but also vain and loquacious, and determined to
make his way at any cost. Even when a school-boy he looked
down on all his companions.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> As child, youth, man, and in
mature years, he was always the same, Erasmus tells us;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> that
is to say, vain, envious, jealous, boasting, passionate, and revengeful.
We must bear in mind, however, that when Erasmus
describes the character of his opponents, he is far from being
an impartial judge. In the bosom of Roman-catholicism, there
have always existed well-meaning, though ill-informed men,
who, not knowing the interior power of the word of God, have
thought that if its authority were substituted for that of the
Romish church, the only foundation of truth and of Christia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>n
society would be shaken. Yet while we judge Lee less severely
than Erasmus does, we cannot close our eyes to his faults. His
memory was richly furnished, but his heart was a stranger to
divine truth: he was a schoolman and not a believer. He
wanted the people to obey the church and not trouble themselves
about the Scriptures. He was the Doctor Eck of England,
but with more of outward appearance and morality than
Luther's adversary. Yet he was by no means a rigid moralist.
On one occasion, when preaching at the palace, he introduced
ballads into his sermon, one of which began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Pass time with good company."<br />
</p>

<p>And the other:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"I love unloved."<br />
</p>

<p>We are indebted to Secretary Pace for this characteristic
trait.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>During the sojourn of Erasmus in England, Lee, observing
his influence, had sought his friendship, and Erasmus, with his
usual courtesy, had solicited his advice upon his work. But
Lee, jealous of his great reputation, only waited for an opportunity
to injure it, which he seized upon as soon as it occurred.
The New Testament had not been long published, when Lee
turned round abruptly, and from being Erasmus's friend became
his implacable adversary.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> "If we do not stop this leak," said
he, when he heard of the New Testament, "it will sink the
ship." Nothing terrifies the defenders of human traditions so
much as the word of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEE'S MANIFESTO.</div>

<p>Lee immediately leagued himself with all those in England
who abhorred the study of Scripture, says Erasmus. Although
exceedingly conceited, he showed himself the most amiable of
men, in order to accomplish his designs. He invited Englishmen
to his house, welcomed strangers, and gained many recruits
by the excellence of his dinners.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> While seated at table among
his guests, he hinted perfidious charges against Erasmus, and
his company left him "loaded with lies."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>&mdash;"In this New Testament,"
said he, "there are three hundred dangerous, frightful
passages ... three hundred did I say? ... there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
are more than a thousand!" Not satisfied with using his
tongue, Lee wrote scores of letters, and employed several secretaries.
Was there any convent in the odour of sanctity, he
"forwarded to it instantly wine, choice viands, and other presents."
To each one he assigned his part, and over all England
they were rehearsing what Erasmus calls <i>Lee's tragedy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In this
manner they were preparing the catastrophe: a prison for Erasmus,
the fire for the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>When all was arranged, Lee issued his manifesto. Although
a poor Greek scholar,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> he drew up some <i>Annotations</i> on Erasmus's
book, which the latter called "mere abuse and blasphemy;"
but which the members of the league regarded as <i>oracles</i>. They
passed them secretly from hand to hand, and these obscure
sheets, by many indirect channels, found their way into every
part of England, and met with numerous readers.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> There was
to be no publication&mdash;such was the watchword; Lee was too
much afraid. "Why did you not publish your work," asked
Erasmus, with cutting irony. "Who knows whether the holy
father, appointing you the Aristarchus of letters, might not
have sent you a birch to keep the whole world in order!"<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Annotations</i> having triumphed in the convents, the <i>conspiracy</i>
took a new flight. In every place of public resort, at
fairs and markets, at the dinner-table and in the council-chamber,
in shops, and taverns, and houses of ill-fame, in churches
and in the universities, in cottages and in palaces, the league blattered
against Erasmus and the Greek Testament.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Carmelites,
Dominicans, and Sophists, invoked heaven and conjured hell.
What need was there of Scripture? Had they not the apostolical
succession of the clergy? No hostile landing in England
could, in their eyes, be more fatal than that of the New Testament.
The whole nation must rise to repel this impudent
invasion. There is, perhaps, no country in Europe, where the
Reformation was received by so unexpected a storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE UNIVERSITIES.</div>

<p>While this rude blast was rushing over England, and roaring
in the long galleries of its convents, the still small voice of the
Word was making its way into the peaceful homes of praying
men and the ancient halls of Oxford and Cambridge. In private
chambers, in the lecture-rooms and refectories, students, and
even masters of arts, were to be seen reading the Greek and
Latin Testament. Animated groups were discussing the principles
of the Reformation. When Christ came on earth (said
some) He gave the word, and when He ascended up into heaven
He gave the Holy Spirit. These are the two forces which created
the church&mdash;and these are the forces that must regenerate
it.&mdash;No (replied the partizans of Rome), it was the teaching of
the apostles at first, and it is the teaching of the priests now.&mdash;The
apostles (rejoined the friends of the Testament of Erasmus)&mdash;yes,
it is true&mdash;the apostles were during their ministry a
living Scripture; but their oral teaching would infallibly have
been altered by passing from mouth to mouth. God willed,
therefore, that these precious lessons should be preserved to us
in their writings, and thus become the ever-undefiled source of
truth and salvation. To set the Scriptures in the foremost
place, as your pretended reformers are doing (replied the schoolmen
of Oxford and Cambridge); is to propagate heresy! And
what are the reformers doing (asked their apologists) except
what Christ did before them? The sayings of the prophets
existed in the time of Jesus only as <i>Scripture</i>, and it was to this
written Word that our Lord appealed when he founded his
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> And now in like manner the teaching of the apostles
exists only as Scripture, and it is to this written word that
we appeal in order to re-establish the kingdom of our Lord in
its primitive condition. The night is far spent, the day is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hand; all is in motion&mdash;in the lofty halls of our colleges, in the
mansions of the rich and noble, and in the lowly dwellings of
the poor. If we want to scatter the darkness, must we light
the shrivelled wick of some old lamp? Ought we not rather to
open the doors and shutters and admit freely into the house the
great light which God has placed in the heavens?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOMAS BILNEY.</div>

<p>There was in Trinity Hall, Cambridge, a young doctor
much given to the study of the canon law, of serious turn of
mind and bashful disposition, and whose tender conscience strove,
although ineffectually, to fulfil the commandments of God.
Anxious about his salvation, Thomas Bilney applied to the
priests, whom he looked upon as physicians of the soul. Kneeling
before his confessor, with humble look and pale face, he
told him all his sins, and even those of which he doubted.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The
priest prescribed at one time fasting, at another prolonged vigils,
and then masses and indulgences which cost him dearly.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The
poor doctor went through all these practices with great devotion,
but found no consolation in them. Being weak and slender,
his body wasted away by degrees;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> his understanding grew
weaker, his imagination faded, and his purse became empty.
"Alas!" said he with anguish, "my last state is worse than the
first." From time to time an idea crossed his mind: "May not
the priests be seeking their own interest, and not the salvation
of my soul."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> But immediately rejecting the rash doubt, he
fell back under the iron hand of the clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEGINNING OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>One day Bilney heard his friends talking about a new book:
it was the Greek Testament printed with a translation which
was highly praised for its elegant Latinity.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Attracted by the
beauty of the style rather than by the divinity of the subject,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
he stretched out his hand; but just as he was going to take the
volume, fear came upon him and he withdrew it hastily. In fact
the confessors strictly prohibited Greek and Hebrew books, "the
sources of all heresies;" and Erasmus's Testament was particularly
forbidden. Yet Bilney regretted so great a sacrifice; was
it not the Testament of Jesus Christ? Might not God have
placed therein some word which perhaps might heal his soul?
He stepped forward, and then again shrank back.... At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
last he took courage. Urged, said he, by the hand of God, he
walked out of the college, slipped into the house where the volume
was sold in secret, bought it with fear and trembling, and
then hastened back and shut himself up in his room.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>He opened it&mdash;his eyes caught these words: <i>This is a faithful
saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief</i>.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> He laid
down the book, and meditated on the astonishing declaration.
"What! St. Paul the chief of sinners, and yet St. Paul is sure
of being saved!" He read the verse again and again. "O
assertion of St. Paul, how sweet art thou to my soul!" he exclaimed.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
This declaration continually haunted him, and in
this manner God instructed him in the secret of his heart.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> He
could not tell what had happened to him;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> it seemed as if a
refreshing wind were blowing over his soul, or as if a rich treasure
had been placed in his hands. The Holy Spirit took what
was Christ's, and announced it to him. "I also am like Paul,"
exclaimed he with emotion, "and more than Paul, the greatest
of sinners!... But Christ saves sinners. At last I have
heard of Jesus."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>His doubts were ended&mdash;he was saved. Then took place in
him a wonderful transformation. An unknown joy pervaded
him;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> his conscience until then sore with the wounds of sin was
healed;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> instead of despair he felt an inward peace passing all
understanding.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> "Jesus Christ," exclaimed he, "Yes, Jesus
Christ saves!"... Such is the character of the Reformation:
it is Jesus Christ who saves and not the church. "I see
it all," said Bilney; "my vigils, my fasts, my pilgrimages, my
purchase of masses and indulgences, were destroying instead of
saving me.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> All these efforts were, as St. Augustine says, a
hasty running out of the right way."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Bilney never grew tired of reading his New Testament. He
no longer lent an attentive ear to the teaching of the schoolmen;
he heard Jesus at Capernaum, Peter in the temple, Paul on
Mars' hill, and felt within himself that Christ possesses the
words of eternal life. A witness to Jesus Christ had just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
born by the same power which had transformed Paul, Apollos,
and Timothy. The Reformation of England was beginning.
Bilney was united to the Son of God, not by a remote succession,
but by an immediate generation. Leaving to the disciples of
the pope the entangled chain of their imaginary succession,
whose links it is impossible to disengage, he attached himself
closely to Christ. The word of the first century gave birth to
the sixteenth. Protestantism does not descend from the
Gospel in the fiftieth generation like the Romish church of the
Council of Trent, or in the sixtieth like some modern doctors:
it is the direct legitimate son&mdash;the son of the master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VALE OF THE SEVERN.</div>

<p>God's action was not limited to one spot. The first rays of
the sun from on high gilded with their fires at once the gothic
colleges of Oxford and the antique schools of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Along the banks of the Severn extends a picturesque country,
bounded by the forest of Dean, and sprinkled with villages,
steeples, and ancient castles. In the sixteenth century it was
particularly admired by priests and friars, and a familiar oath
among them was: "As sure as God's in Glo'ster!" The papal
birds of prey had swooped upon it. For fifty years, from 1484
to 1534, four Italian bishops, placed in succession over the diocese,
had surrendered it to the pope, to the monks, and to
immorality. Thieves in particular were the objects of the tenderest
favours of the hierarchy. John de Giglis, collector of
the apostolical chamber, had received from the sovereign pontiff
authority to pardon murder and theft, on condition that the
criminal shared his profits with the pontifical commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELIZATION AT OXFORD.</div>

<p>In this valley, at the foot of Stinchcomb hill, to the south-west
of Gloucester, there dwelt, during the latter half of the
fifteenth century, a family which had taken refuge there during
the wars of the Roses, and assumed the name of Hutchins. In
the reign of Henry VII, the Lancasterian party having the
upper hand, they resumed their name of Tyndale, which had
been borne of yore by many noble barons.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> In 1484, about
a year after the birth of Luther, and about the time that Zwingle
first saw light in the mountains of the Tockenburg, these
partisans of the <i>red rose</i> were blessed with a son, whom they
called William. His youth was passed in the fields surrounding
his native village of North Nibley, beneath the shadows of
Berkeley Castle, or beside the rapid waters of the Severn, and
in the midst of friars and pontifical collectors. He was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
very early to Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> where he learnt grammar and philosophy
in the school of St. Mary Magdalene, adjoining the college of
that name. He made rapid progress, particularly in languages,
under the first classical scholars in England&mdash;Grocyn, W. Latimer,
and Linacre&mdash;and took his degrees.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> A more excellent
master than these doctors&mdash;the Holy Spirit speaking in Scripture&mdash;was
soon to teach him a science which it is not in the
power of man to impart.</p>

<p>Oxford, where Erasmus had so many friends, was the city in
which his New Testament met with the warmest welcome. The
young Gloucestershire student, inwardly impelled towards the
study of sacred literature, read the celebrated book which was
then attracting the attention of Christendom. At first he regarded
it only as a work of learning, or at most as a manual of
piety, whose beauties were calculated to excite religious feelings;
but erelong he found it to be something more. The more he
read it, the more was he struck by the truth and energy of the
word. The strange book spoke to him of God, of Christ, and
of regeneration, with a simplicity and authority which completely
subdued him. William had found a master whom he
had not sought at Oxford&mdash;this was God himself. The pages
he held in his hand were the divine revelation so long mislaid.
Possessing a noble soul, a bold spirit, and indefatigable activity,
he did not keep this treasure to himself. He uttered that cry,
more suited to a Christian than to Archimedes: &#949;&#8021;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;, <i>I have
found it</i>. It was not long before several of the younger members
of the university, attracted by the purity of his life and the
charms of his conversation,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> gathered round him, and read with
him the Greek and Latin gospels of Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> "A certain
well-informed young man," wrote Erasmus in a letter wherein
he speaks of the publication of his New Testament, "began to
lecture with success on Greek literature at Oxford."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> He was
probably speaking of Tyndale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY TEACHES AT CAMBRIDGE.</div>

<p>The monks took the alarm. "<i>A barbarian</i>," continues Erasmus,
"entered the pulpit and violently abused the Greek language."&mdash;"These
folk," said Tyndale, "wished to extinguish
the light which exposed their trickery, and they have been laying
their plans these dozen years."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> This observation was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in 1531, and refers therefore to the proceedings of 1517.
Germany and England were beginning the struggle at nearly
the same time, and Oxford perhaps before Wittemberg. Tyndale,
bearing in mind the injunction: "When they persecute you
in one city, flee ye into another," left Oxford and proceeded to
Cambridge. It must needs be that souls whom God has brought
to his knowledge should meet and enlighten one another: live
coals, when separated, go out; when gathered together, they
brighten up, so as even to purify silver and gold. The Romish
hierarchy, not knowing what they did, were collecting the scattered
brands of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Bilney was not inactive at Cambridge. Not long had the
"sublime lesson of Jesus Christ" filled him with joy, before he
fell on his knees and exclaimed: "O Thou who art the truth,
give me strength that I may teach it; and convert the ungodly
by means of one who has been ungodly himself."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> After this
prayer his eyes gleamed with new fire; he had assembled his
friends, and opening Erasmus's Testament, had placed his finger
on the words that had reached his soul, and these words had
touched many. The arrival of Tyndale gave him fresh courage,
and the light burnt brighter in Cambridge.</p>

<p>John Fryth, a young man of eighteen, the son of an innkeeper
of Sevenoaks in Kent, was distinguished among the students
of King's College, by the promptitude of his understanding
and the integrity of his life. He was as deeply read in the
mathematics as Tyndale in the classics, and Bilney in canon law.
Although of an exact turn of mind, yet his soul was elevated,
and he recognised in Holy Scripture a learning of a new kind.
"These things are not demonstrated like a proposition of Euclid,"
he said; "mere study is sufficient to impress the theories of
mathematics on our minds; but this science of God meets with
a resistance in man that necessitates the intervention of a divine
power. Christianity is a regeneration." The heavenly seed
soon grew up in Fryth's heart.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>These three young scholars set to work with enthusiasm.
They declared that neither priestly absolution nor any other
religious rite could give remission of sins; that the assurance of
pardon is obtained by faith alone; and that faith purifies the
heart. Then they addressed to all men that saying of Christ's
at which the monks were so offended: <i>Repent and be converted!</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRIST COMETH.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Ideas so new produced a great clamour. A famous orator
undertook one day at Cambridge to show that it was useless to
preach conversion to the sinner. "Thou, who, for sixty years
past," said he, "hast wallowed in thy lusts, like a sow in her
mire,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> dost thou think that thou canst in one year take as many
steps towards heaven, and that in thine age, as thou hast done
towards hell?" Bilney left the church with indignation. "Is
that preaching repentance in the name of Jesus?" he asked.
"Does not this priest tell us: Christ will not save thee.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Alas!
for so many years that this deadly doctrine has been taught in
Christendom, not one man has dared open his mouth against
it!" Many of the Cambridge fellows were scandalized at Bilney's
language: was not the preacher whose teaching he condemned
duly <i>ordained</i> by the bishop? He replied: "What
would be the use of being a hundred times consecrated, were it
even by a thousand papal bulls, if the inward calling is wanting?<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
To no purpose hath the bishop breathed on our heads if we
have never felt the breath of the Holy Ghost in our hearts?"
Thus, at the very beginning of the Reformation, England, rejecting
the Romish superstitions, discerned with extreme nicety
what constitutes the essence of consecration to the service of
the Lord.</p>

<p>After pronouncing these noble words, Bilney, who longed for
an outpouring of the Holy Ghost, shut himself up in his room,
fell on his knees, and called upon God to come to the assistance
of his church. Then rising up, he exclaimed, as if animated by
a prophetic spirit: "A new time is beginning. The Christian
assembly is about to be renewed.... Some one is coming
unto us, I see him, I hear him&mdash;it is Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>...
He is the king, and it is he who will call the true ministers
commissioned to evangelize his people."</p>

<p>Tyndale, full of the same hopes as Bilney, left Cambridge in
the course of the year 1519.</p>

<p>Thus the English Reformation began independently of those
of Luther and Zwingle&mdash;deriving its origin from God alone. In
every province of Christendom there was a simultaneous action
of the divine word. The principle of the Reformation at Oxford,
Cambridge, and London was the <i>Greek New Testament</i>,
published by Erasmus. England, in course of time learnt to be
proud of this origin of its Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM OF THE CLERGY.</div>

<p>This revival caused great alarm throughout the Roman
hierarchy. Content with the baptism they administered, they
feared the baptism of the Holy Ghost perfected by faith in the
word of God. Some of the clergy, who were full of zeal, but
of zeal without knowledge, prepared for the struggle, and the
cries raised by the prelates were repeated by all the inferior
orders.</p>

<p>The first blows did not fall on the members of the universities,
but on those humble Christians, the relics of Wickliffe's
ministry, to whom the reform movement among the learned
had imparted a new life. The awakening of the fourteenth
century was about to be succeeded by that of the sixteenth,
and the last gleams of the closing day were almost lost in the
first rays of that which was commencing. The young doctors
of Oxford and Cambridge aroused the attention of the alarmed
hierarchy, and attracted their eyes to the humble Lollards, who
here and there still recalled the days of Wickliffe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COVENTRY MARTYRS.</div>

<p>An artisan named Thomas Man, sometimes called Doctor
Man, from his knowledge of Holy Scripture, had been imprisoned
for his faith in the priory of Frideswide at Oxford (1511 <small>A. D.</small>)
Tormented by the remembrance of a recantation which had
been extorted from him, he had escaped from this monastery
and fled into the eastern parts of England, where he had preached
the Word, supplying his daily wants by the labour of his hands.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
This "champion of God" afterwards drew near the capital, and
assisted by his wife, the new Priscilla of this new Aquila, he
proclaimed the doctrine of Christ to the crowd collected around
him in some "upper chamber" of London, or in some lonely
meadow watered by the Thames, or under the aged oaks of
Windsor Forest. He thought with Chrysostom of old, that "all
priests are not saints, but all saints are priests."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> "He that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
receiveth the word of God," said he, "receiveth God himself,
that is the true <i>real presence</i>. The vendors of masses are not
the high-priests of this mystery;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> but the men whom God hath
<i>anointed with his Spirit</i> to be kings and priests." From six to
seven hundred persons were converted by his preaching.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>The monks who dared not as yet attack the universities, resolved
to fall upon those preachers who made their temple on
the banks of the Thames, or in some remote corner of the city.
Man was seized, condemned, and burnt alive on the 29th March
1519.</p>

<p>And this was not all. There lived at Coventry a little band
of serious Christians&mdash;four shoemakers, a glover, a hosier, and
a widow named Smith&mdash;who gave their children a pious education.
The Franciscans were annoyed that <i>laymen</i>, and even a
<i>woman</i>, should dare meddle with religious instruction. On Ash
Wednesday (1519) Simon Morton, the bishop's sumner, apprehended
them all, men, women, and children. On the following
Friday, the parents were taken to the Abbey of Mackstock,
about six miles from Coventry, and the children to the Grey
Friar's convent. "Let us see what heresies you have been
taught?" said Friar Stafford to the intimidated little ones. The
poor children confessed they had been taught in English the
Lord's prayer, the apostles' creed, and the ten commandments.
On hearing this, Stafford told them angrily: "I forbid you,
(unless you wish to be burnt as your parents will be,) to have
any thing to do with the <i>Pater</i>, the <i>credo</i>, or the ten commandments
<i>in English</i>."</p>

<p>Five weeks after this, the men were condemned to be burnt
alive, but the judges had compassion on the widow, because of
her young family (for she was their only support,) and let her
go. It was night: Morton offered to see Dame Smith home;
she took his arm, and they threaded the dark and narrow streets
of Coventry. "Eh, eh!" said the apparitor, on a sudden,
"what have we here?" He heard in fact the noise of paper
rubbing against something. "What have you got there?" he
continued, dropping her arm, and putting his hand up her sleeve,
from which he drew out a parchment. Approaching a window
whence issued the faint rays of a lamp, he examined the mysterious
scroll, and found it to contain the Lord's prayer, the
apostles' creed, and the ten commandments <i>in English</i>. "Oh,
oh! sirrah!" said he; "come along. As good now as another
time!"<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Then seizing the poor widow by the arm, he dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
her before the bishop. Sentence of death was immediately pronounced
on her, and on the 4th of April, Dame Smith, Robert
Hatchets, Archer, Hawkins, Thomas Bond, Wrigsham, and
Landsdale, were burnt alive at Coventry in the Little Park, for
the crime of teaching their children the Lord's prayer, the apostles'
creed, and the commandments of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STANDISH AT ST. PAUL'S.</div>

<p>But what availed it to silence these obscure lips, so long as
the Testament of Erasmus could speak? Lee's conspiracy must
be revived. Standish, bishop of St. Asaph, was a narrow-minded
man, rather fanatical, but probably sincere, of great courage,
and not without some degree of piety. This prelate, being determined
to preach a crusade against the New Testament, began
at London, in St. Paul's cathedral, before the mayor and corporation.
"Away with these new translations," he said, "or else
the religion of Jesus Christ is threatened with utter ruin."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
But Standish was deficient in tact, and instead of confining himself
to general statements, like most of his party, he endeavoured
to show how far Erasmus had corrupted the Gospel, and continued
thus in a whining voice: "Must I who for so many years
have been a doctor of the Holy Scriptures, and who have always
read in my Bible: <i>In principio erat</i> <small>VERBUM</small>,&mdash;must I now be
obliged to read: <i>In principio erat</i> <small>SERMO</small>," for thus had Erasmus
translated the opening words of St. John's Gospel. <i>Risum
teneatis</i>, whispered one to another, when they heard this puerile
charge: "My lord," proceeded the bishop, turning to the mayor,
"magistrates of the city, and citizens all, fly to the succour
of religion!" Standish continued his pathetic appeals, but
his oratory was all in vain; some stood unmoved, others
shrugged their shoulders, and others grew impatient. The
citizens of London seemed determined to support liberty and
the Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DISCUSSION.</div>

<p>Standish, seeing the failure of his attack in the city, sighed
and groaned and prayed, and repeated mass against the so much
dreaded book. But he also made up his mind to do more. One
day, during the rejoicings at court for the betrothal of the
Princess Mary, then two years old, with a French prince who
was just born, St. Asaph, absorbed and absent in the midst of
the gay crowd, meditated a bold step. Suddenly he made his
way through the crowd, and threw himself at the feet of the
king and queen. All were thunder-struck, and asked one
another what the old bishop could mean. "Great king," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
he, "your ancestors who have reigned over this island,&mdash;and
yours, O great queen, who have governed Aragon, were always
distinguished by their zeal for the church. Show yourselves
worthy of your forefathers. Times full of danger are come
upon us,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> a book has just appeared, and been published too, by
Erasmus! It is such a book that, if you close not your kingdom
against it, it is all over with the religion of Christ among
us."</p>

<p>The bishop ceased, and a dead silence ensued. The devout
Standish, fearing lest Henry's well-known love of learning should
be an obstacle to his prayer, raised his eyes and his hands toward
heaven, and kneeling in the midst of the courtly assembly, exclaimed
in a sorrowful tone: "O Christ! O Son of God! save
thy spouse! ... for no man cometh to her help."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the prelate, whose courage was worthy
of a better cause, rose up and waited. Every one strove to
guess at the king's thoughts. Sir Thomas More was present,
and he could not forsake his friend Erasmus. "What are the
heresies this book is likely to engender?" he inquired. After
the sublime came the ridiculous. With the forefinger of his
right hand, touching successively the fingers of his left,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Standish
replied: "First, this book destroys <i>the resurrection</i>; secondly, it
annuls the <i>sacrament of marriage</i>; thirdly, it abolishes <i>the
mass</i>." Then uplifting his thumb and two fingers, he showed
them to the assembly with a look of triumph. The bigoted
Catherine shuddered as she saw Standish's three fingers,&mdash;signs
of the three heresies of Erasmus; and Henry himself, an admirer
of Aquinas, was embarrassed. It was a critical moment: the
Greek Testament was on the point of being banished from England.
"The proof, the proof," exclaimed the friends of literature.
"I will give it," rejoined the impetuous Standish, and then once
more touching his left thumb: "Firstly," he said, ... But
he brought forward such foolish reasons, that even the women
and the unlearned were ashamed of them. The more he endeavoured
to justify his assertions, the more confused he became:
he affirmed among other things that the Epistles of St.
Paul were written in <i>Hebrew</i>. "There is not a schoolboy that
does not know that Paul's epistles were written in <i>Greek</i>," said
a doctor of divinity kneeling before the king. Henry, blushing
for the bishop, turned the conversation, and Standish, ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
at having made a Greek write to the Greeks in Hebrew, would
have withdrawn unobserved. "The beetle must not attack the
eagle,"<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> was whispered in his ear. Thus did the book of God
remain in England the standard of a faithful band, who found
in its pages the motto, which the church of Rome had usurped:
<i>The truth is in me alone</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S AMBITION.</div>

<p>A more formidable adversary than Standish aspired to combat
the Reformation, not only in England, but in all the West.
One of those ambitious designs, which easily germinate in the
human heart, developed itself in the soul of the chief minister
of Henry VIII; and if this project succeeded, it promised to
secure for ever the empire of the papacy on the banks of the
Thames, and perhaps in the whole of Christendom.</p>

<p>Wolsey, as chancellor and legate, governed both in state and
in church, and could, without an untruth, utter his famous <i>Ego
et rex meus</i>. Having reached so great a height, he desired to
soar still higher. The favourite of Henry VIII, almost his
master, treated as a brother by the emperor, by the king of
France, and by other crowned heads, invested with the title of
Majesty, the peculiar property of sovereigns,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> the cardinal, sincere
in his faith in the popedom, aspired to fill the throne of
the pontiffs, and thus become <i>Deus in terris</i>. He thought, that
if God permitted a Luther to appear in the world, it was because
he had a Wolsey to oppose to him.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to fix the precise moment when this immoderate
desire entered his mind: it was about the end of 1518
that it began to show itself. The bishop of Ely, ambassador at
the court of Francis I, being in conference with that prince on
the 18th of December in that year, said to him mysteriously:
"The cardinal has an idea in his mind ... on which he
can unbosom himself to nobody ... except it be to your
majesty." Francis understood him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBITION OF FRANCIS I.</div>

<p>An event occurred to facilitate the cardinal's plans. If
Wolsey desired to be the first priest, Henry desired to be the
first king. The imperial crown, vacant by the death of Maximilian,
was sought by two princes:&mdash;by Charles of Austria, a
cold and calculating man, caring little about the pleasures and
even the pomp of power, but forming great designs, and knowing
how to pursue them with energy; and by Francis I, a man of
less penetrating glance and less indefatigable activity, but more
daring and impetuous. Henry VIII, inferior to both, passionate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
capricious, and selfish, thought himself strong enough to contend
with such puissant competitors, and secretly strove to win
"the monarchy of all Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Wolsey flattered himself
that, hidden under the cloak of his master's ambition, he might
satisfy his own. If he procured the crown of the Cæsars for
Henry, he might easily obtain the tiara of the popes for himself;
if he failed, the least that could be done to compensate England
for the loss of the empire, would be to give the sovereignty of
the church to her prime minister.</p>

<p>Henry first sounded the king of France. Sir Thomas Boleyn
appeared one day before Francis I just as the latter was returning
from mass. The king, desirous to anticipate a confidence
that might be embarrassing, took the ambassador aside to the
window and whispered to him: "Some of the electors have
offered me the empire; I hope your master will be favourable to
me." Sir Thomas, in confusion, made some vague reply, and the
chivalrous king, following up his idea, took the ambassador
firmly by one hand, and laying the other on his breast,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> exclaimed:
"By my faith, if I become emperor, in three years I shall
be in Constantinople, or I shall die on the road!" This was
not what Henry wanted; but dissembling his wishes, he took
care to inform Francis that he would support his candidature.
Upon hearing this Francis raised his hat and exclaimed: "I desire
to see the king of England; I will see him, I tell you, even
if I go to London with only one page and one lackey."</p>

<p>Francis was well aware that if he threatened the king's ambition,
he must flatter the minister's, and recollecting the hint
given by the bishop of Ely, he said one day to Boleyn: "It
seems to me that my brother of England and I could do, indeed
ought to do ... something for the cardinal. He was prepared
by God for the good of Christendom ... one of the greatest
men in the church ... and on the word of a king, if he consents,
I will do it." A few minutes after he continued: "Write
and tell the cardinal, that if he aspires to be the head of the
church, and if any thing should happen to the reigning pope, I
will promise him fourteen cardinals on my part.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Let us only
act in concert, your master and me, and I promise you, Mr.
Ambassador, that neither pope nor emperor shall be created in
Europe without our consent."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARDINAL'S PRACTICES.</div>

<p>But Henry did not act in concert with the king of France.
At Wolsey's instigation he supported three candidates at once:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
at Paris he was for Francis I; at Madrid for Charles V; and at
Frankfort for himself. The kings of France and England failed,
and on the 10th August, Pace, Henry's envoy at Frankfort,
having returned to England, desired to console the king by
mentioning the sums of money which Charles had spent. "By
the mass!"<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> exclaimed the king, congratulating himself at not
having obtained the crown at so dear a rate. Wolsey proposed
to sing a <i>Te Deum</i> in St. Paul's, and bonfires were lighted in the
city.</p>

<p>The cardinal's rejoicings were not misplaced. Charles had
scarcely ascended the imperial throne, in despite of the king of
France, when these two princes swore eternal hatred of each
other, and each was anxious to win over Henry VIII. At one
time Charles, under the pretence of seeing his uncle and aunt,
visited England; at another, Francis had an interview with the
king in the neighbourhood of Calais. The cardinal shared in
the flattering attentions of the two monarchs. "It is easy for
the king of Spain, who has become the head of the empire, to
raise whomsoever he pleases to the supreme pontificate," said the
young emperor to him; and at these words the ambitious cardinal
surrendered himself to Maximilian's successor. But erelong
Francis I flattered him in his turn, and Wolsey replied also to
his advances. The king of France gave Henry tournaments
and banquets of Asiatic luxury; and Wolsey, whose countenance
yet bore the marks of the graceful smile with which he had taken
leave of Charles, smiled also on Francis, and sang mass in his
honour. He engaged the hand of the Princess Mary to the
dauphin of France and to Charles V, leaving the care of unravelling
the matter to futurity. Then proud of his skilful practices
he returned to London full of hope. By walking in falsehood
he hoped to attain the tiara: and if it was yet too far above
him, there were certain <i>gospellers</i> in England who might serve
as a ladder to reach it. Murder might serve as the complement
to fraud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE.</div>

<p>Whilst this ambitious prelate was thinking of nothing but
his own glory and that of the Roman pontificate, a great desire,
but of a very different nature, was springing up in the heart of
one of the humble "gospellers" of England. If Wolsey had his
eyes fixed on the throne of the popedom in order to seat himself
there, Tyndale thought of raising up the true throne of the church
by re-establishing the legitimate sovereignty of the word of
God. The Greek Testament of Erasmus had been one step;
and it now became necessary to place before the simple what
the king of the schools had given to the learned. This idea,
which pursued the young Oxford doctor everywhere, was to be
the mighty mainspring of the English Reformation.</p>

<p>On the slope of Sodbury hill there stood a plain but large
mansion commanding an extensive view over the beautiful vale
of the Severn where Tyndale was born. It was inhabited by a
family of gentle birth: Sir John Walsh had shone in the tournaments
of the court, and by this means conciliated the favour of his
prince. He kept open table; and gentlemen, deans, abbots, archdeacons,
doctors of divinity, and fat rectors, charmed by Sir
John's cordial welcome and by his good dinners, were ever at
his house. The former brother at arms of Henry VIII felt an
interest in the questions then discussing throughout Christendom.
Lady Walsh herself, a sensible and generous woman, lost not a
word of the animated conversation of her guests, and discreetly
tried to incline the balance to the side of truth.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TABLE-TALK AT SODBURY.</div>

<p>Tyndale after leaving Oxford and Cambridge had returned to
the home of his fathers. Sir John had requested him to educate
his children, and he had accepted. William was then in the prime
of life (he was about thirty-six), well instructed in Scripture,
and full of desire to show forth the light which God had given
him. Opportunities were not wanting. Seated at table with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
all the doctors welcomed by Sir John,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Tyndale entered into conversation
with them. They talked of the learned men of the
day&mdash;of Erasmus much, and sometimes of Luther, who was beginning
to astonish England.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> They discussed several questions
touching the holy Scriptures, and sundry points of theology.
Tyndale expressed his convictions with admirable clearness,
supported them with great learning, and kept his ground against
all with unbending courage. These animated conversations in
the vale of the Severn are one of the essential features of the
picture presented by the Reformation in this country. The
historians of antiquity invented the speeches which they have put
into the mouths of their heroes. In our times history, without
inventing, should make us acquainted with the sentiments of the
persons of whom it treats. It is sufficient to read Tyndale's
works to form some idea of these conversations. It is from his
writings that the following discussion has been drawn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.</div>

<p>In the dining-room of the old hall a varied group was assembled
round the hospitable table. There were Sir John and
Lady Walsh, a few gentlemen of the neighbourhood, with several
abbots, deans, monks, and doctors, in their respective costumes.
Tyndale occupied the humblest place, and generally kept Erasmus's
New Testament within reach in order to prove what he
advanced.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Numerous domestics were moving about engaged
in waiting on the guests; and at length the conversation, after
wandering a little, took a more precise direction. The priests grew
impatient when they saw the terrible volume appear. "Your
Scriptures only serve to make heretics," they exclaimed. "On
the contrary," replied Tyndale, "the source of all heresies is
<i>pride</i>; now the word of God strips man of everything, and leaves
him as bare as Job."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>&mdash;"<i>The word of God!</i> why even <i>we</i> don't
understand your word, how can the <i>vulgar</i> understand it?"&mdash;"You
do not understand it," rejoined Tyndale, "because you look
into it only for foolish questions, as you would into <i>our Lady's
Matins</i>, or <i>Merlin's Prophecies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Now the Scriptures are a clue
which we must follow, without turning aside, until we arrive at
Christ;<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> for Christ is the end."&mdash;"And I tell you," shouted
out a priest, "that the Scriptures are a Dædalian labyrinth, rather
than Ariadne's clue&mdash;a conjuring book wherein everybody
finds what he wants."&mdash;"Alas!" replied Tyndale; "you read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
them without Jesus Christ; that's why they are an obscure book
to you. What do I say? a den of thorns where you only escape
from the briers to be caught by the brambles."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> "No!" exclaimed
another clerk, heedless of contradicting his colleague,
"nothing is obscure to us; it is we who give the Scriptures,
and we who explain them to you."&mdash;"You would lose both
your time and your trouble," said Tyndale; "do you know who
taught the eagles to find their prey?<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Well, that same God
teaches his hungry children to find their Father in his
word. Far from having given us the Scriptures, it is you
who have hidden them from us; it is you who burn those who
teach them, and if you could, you would burn the Scriptures
themselves."</p>

<p>Tyndale was not satisfied with merely laying down the great
principles of faith: he alway sought after what he calls "the
sweet marrow within;" but to the divine unction he added no
little humour, and unmercifully ridiculed the superstitions of his
adversaries. "You set candles before images," he said to them;
"and since you give them <i>light</i>, why don't you give them <i>food</i>.
Why don't you make their bellies hollow, and put victuals and
drink inside.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> To serve God by such mummeries is treating
him like a spoilt child, whom you pacify with a toy or with a
horse made of a stick."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>But the learned Christian soon returned to more serious
thoughts; and when his adversaries extolled the papacy as the
power that would save the church in the tempest, he replied:
"Let us only take on board the anchor of faith, after having
dipped it in the blood of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and when the storm bursts
upon us, let us boldly cast the anchor into the sea; then you
may be sure the ship will remain safe on the great waters."
And, in fine, if his opponents rejected any doctrine of the truth,
Tyndale (says the chronicler) opening his Testament would set
his finger on the verse which refuted the Romish error, and exclaim:
"Look and read."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SERMONS AT ST. ADELINE'S.</div>

<p>The beginnings of the English Reformation are not to be
found, as we have seen, in a material ecclesiasticism, which has
been decorated with the name of <i>English Catholicism:</i> they are
essentially spiritual. The Divine Word, the creator of the new
life in the individual, is also the founder and reformer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
church. The reformed churches, and particularly the reformed
churches of Great Britain, belong to evangelism.</p>

<p>The contemplation of God's works refreshed Tyndale after
the discussions he had to maintain at his patron's table. He
would often ramble to the top of Sodbury hill, and there repose
amidst the ruins of an ancient Roman camp which crowned the
summit. It was here that Queen Margaret of Anjou halted;
and here too rested Edward IV, who pursued her, before the
fatal battle of Tewkesbury, which caused this princess to fall
into the hands of the White Rose. Amidst these ruins, monuments
of the Roman invasion and of the civil dissensions of
England, Tyndale meditated upon other battles, which were to
restore liberty and truth to Christendom. Then rousing himself
he would descend the hill, and courageously resume his
task.</p>

<p>Behind the mansion stood a little church, overshadowed by
two large yew trees, and dedicated to Saint Adeline. On Sundays
Tyndale used to preach there, Sir John and Lady Walsh,
with the eldest of the children, occupying the manorial pew.
This humble sanctuary was filled by their household and tenantry,
listening attentively to the words of their teacher, which
fell from his lips like <i>the waters of Shiloah that go softly</i>. Tyndale
was very lively in conversation; but he explained the Scriptures
with so much unction, says the chronicler, "that his hearers
thought they heard St. John himself." If he resembled John
in the mildness of his language, he resembled Paul in the strength
of his doctrine. "According to the pope," he said, "we must
first be good after his doctrine, and compel God to be good
again for our goodness. Nay, verily, God's goodness is the root
of all goodness. Antichrist turneth the tree of salvation topsy-turvy:<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
he planteth the branches, and setteth the roots upwards.
We must put it straight......As the husband marrieth the
wife, before he can have any lawful children by her; even so
faith justifieth us to make us fruitful in good works.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But
neither the one nor the other should remain barren. Faith is
the holy candle wherewith we must bless ourselves at the last
hour; without it, you will go astray in the valley of the shadow
of death, though you had a thousand tapers lighted around your
bed."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE THWARTED BY THE PRIESTS.</div>

<p>The priests, irritated at such observations, determined to ruin
Tyndale, and some of them invited Sir John and his lady to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
entertainment, at which he was not present. During dinner,
they so abused the young doctor and his New Testament, that
his patrons retired greatly annoyed that their tutor should have
made so many enemies. They told him all they had heard,
and Tyndale successfully refuted his adversaries' arguments.
"What!" exclaimed Lady Walsh, "there are some of these
doctors worth one hundred, some two hundred, and some three
hundred pounds<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> ... and were it reason, think you, Master
William, that we should believe you before them?" Tyndale,
opening the New Testament, replied: "No! it is not me you
should believe. That is what the priests have told you; but
look here, St. Peter, St. Paul, and the Lord himself say quite
the contrary."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The Word of God was there, positive and
supreme: the sword of the spirit cut the difficulty.</p>

<p>Before long the manor-house and St. Adeline's church became
too narrow for Tyndale's zeal. He preached every Sunday,
sometimes in a village, sometimes in a town. The inhabitants
of Bristol assembled to hear him in a large meadow, called St.
Austin's Green.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> But no sooner had he preached in any place
than the priests hastened thither, tore up what he had planted,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
called him a heretic, and threatened to expel from the church
every one who dared listen to him. When Tyndale returned
he found the field laid waste by the enemy; and looking sadly
upon it, as the husbandman who sees his corn beaten down by
the hail, and his rich furrows turned into a barren waste, he
exclaimed: "What is to be done? While I am sowing in one
place, the enemy ravages the field I have just left. I cannot
be everywhere. Oh! if Christians possessed the Holy Scriptures
in their own tongue, they could of themselves withstand these
sophists. Without the Bible it is impossible to establish the
laity in the truth."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIESTS IN THE ALEHOUSES.</div>

<p>Then a great idea sprang up in Tyndale's heart: "It was
in the language of Israel," said he, "that the Psalms were sung
in the temple of Jehovah; and shall not the Gospel speak the
language of England among us?... Ought the church to
have less light at noonday than at the dawn?... Christians
must read the New Testament in their mother-tongue." Tyndale
believed that this idea proceeded from God. The new sun
would lead to the discovery of a new world, and the infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rule would make all human diversities give way to a divine unity.
"One holdeth this doctor, another that," said Tyndale, "one
followeth Duns Scotus, another St. Thomas, another Bonaventure,
Alexander Hales, Raymond of Penaford, Lyra, Gorram,
Hugh de Sancto Victore, and so many others besides.... Now,
each of these authors contradicts the other. How then can we
distinguish him who says right from him who says wrong?...
How?... Verily, by God's word."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Tyndale hesitated no
longer.... While Wolsey sought to win the papal tiara, the
humble tutor of Sodbury undertook to place the torch of heaven
in the midst of his fellow-countrymen. The translation of the
Bible shall be the work of his life.</p>

<p>The first triumph of the word was a revolution in the manor-house.
In proportion as Sir John and Lady Walsh acquired a
taste for the Gospel, they became disgusted with the priests.
The clergy were not so often invited to Sodbury, nor did they
meet with the same welcome.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> They soon discontinued their
visits, and thought of nothing but how they could drive Tyndale
from the mansion and from the diocese.</p>

<p>Unwilling to compromise themselves in this warfare, they
sent forward some of those light troops which the church has
always at her disposal. Mendicant friars and poor curates, who
could hardly understand their missal, and the most learned of
whom made <i>Albertus de secretis mulierum</i> their habitual study,
fell upon Tyndale like a pack of hungry hounds. They trooped
to the alehouses,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and calling for a jug of beer, took their seats,
one at one table, another at another. They invited the peasantry
to drink with them, and entering into conversation with
them, poured forth a thousand curses upon the daring reformer:
"He's a hypocrite," said one; "he's a heretic," said another.
The most skilful among them would mount upon a stool, and
turning the tavern into a temple, deliver, for the first time in
his life, an extemporaneous discourse. They reported words
that Tyndale had never uttered, and actions that he had never
committed.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Rushing upon the poor tutor (he himself informs
us) "like unclean swine that follow their carnal lusts,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> they
tore his good name to very tatters, and shared the spoil among
them; while the audience, excited by their calumnies and heated
by the beer, departed overflowing with rage and hatred against
the heretic of Sodbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE CITED BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>After the monks came the dignitaries. The deans and abbots,
Sir John's former guests, accused Tyndale to the chancellor of
the diocese,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and the storm which had begun in the tavern burst
forth in the episcopal palace.</p>

<p>The titular bishop of Worcester (an appanage of the Italian
prelates) was Giulio de' Medici, a learned man, great politician,
and crafty priest, who already governed the popedom without
being pope.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Wolsey, who administered the diocese for his
absent colleague, had appointed Thomas Parker chancellor, a
man devoted to the Roman church. It was to him the churchmen
made their complaint. A judicial inquiry had its difficulties;
the king's companion-at-arms was the patron of the pretended
heretic, and Sir Anthony Poyntz, Lady Walsh's brother,
was sheriff of the county. The chancellor was therefore content
to convoke a general conference of the clergy. Tyndale obeyed
the summons, but foreseeing what awaited him, he cried heartily
to God, as he pursued his way up the banks of the Severn, "to
give him strength to stand fast in the truth of his word."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>When they were assembled, the abbots and deans, and other
ecclesiastics of the diocese, with haughty heads and threatening
looks, crowded round the humble but unbending Tyndale. When
his turn arrived, he stood forward, and the chancellor administered
him a severe reprimand, to which he made a calm reply.
This so exasperated the chancellor, that, giving way to his
passion, he treated Tyndale as if he had been a dog.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> "Where
are your witnesses?" demanded the latter. "Let them come
forward, and I will answer them." Not one of them dared support
the charge&mdash;they looked another way. The chancellor
waited, one witness at least he must have, but he could not get
that.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Annoyed at this desertion of the priests, the representative
of the Medici became more equitable, and let the accusation
drop. Tyndale quietly returned to Sodbury, blessing God who
had saved him from the cruel hands of his adversaries,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and
entertaining nothing but the tenderest charity towards them.
"Take away my goods," he said to them one day, "take away
my good name! yet so long as Christ dwelleth in my heart, so
long shall I love you not a whit the less."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Here indeed is the
Saint John to whom Tyndale has been compared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE AND THE SCHOOLMAN.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>In this violent warfare, however, he could not fail to receive
some heavy blows; and where could he find consolation? Fryth
and Bilney were far from him. Tyndale recollected an <i>aged
doctor</i> who lived near Sodbury, and who had shown him great
affection. He went to see him, and opened his heart to him.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
The old man looked at him for a while as if he hesitated to
disclose some great mystery. "Do you not know," said he,
lowering his voice, "that <i>the pope is very Antichrist</i> whom the
Scripture speaketh of?... But beware what you say....
That knowledge may cost you your life."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> This doctrine of
Antichrist, which Luther was at that moment enunciating so
boldly, struck Tyndale. Strengthened by it, as was the Saxon
reformer, he felt fresh energy in his heart, and the aged doctor
was to him what the aged friar had been to Luther.</p>

<p>When the priests saw that their plot had failed, they commissioned
a celebrated divine to undertake his conversion. The
reformer replied with his Greek Testament to the schoolman's
arguments. The theologian was speechless: at last he exclaimed:
"Well then! it were better to be without God's laws
than the pope's."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Tyndale, who did not expect so plain and
blasphemous a confession, made answer: "And I defy the
pope and all his laws!" and then, as if unable to keep his secret,
he added: "If God spares my life, I will take care that a plough-boy
shall know more of the Scriptures than you do."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>All his thoughts were now directed to the means of carrying
out his plans; and desirous of avoiding conversations that might
compromise them, he thenceforth passed the greater portion of
his time in the library.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> He prayed, he read, he began his
translation of the Bible, and in all probability communicated
portions of it to Sir John and Lady Walsh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE LEAVES SODBURY.</div>

<p>All his precautions were useless: the scholastic divine had
betrayed him, and the priests had sworn to stop him in his
translation of the Bible. One day he fell in with a troop of
monks and curates, who abused him in the grossest manner.
"It's the favour of the gentry of the country that makes you
so proud," said they; "but notwithstanding your patrons, there
will be a talk about you before long, and in a pretty fashion
too!... You shall not always live in a manor-house!"
"Banish me to the obscurest corner of England," replied Tyndale;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"provided you will permit me to teach children and preach
the Gospel, and give me ten pounds a-year for my support.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>...
I shall be satisfied!" The priests left him, but with the
intention of preparing him a very different fate.</p>

<p>Tyndale indulged in his pleasant dreams no longer. He saw
that he was on the point of being arrested, condemned, and interrupted
in his great work. He must seek a retreat where he
can discharge in peace the task God has allotted him. "You
cannot save me from the hands of the priests," said he to Sir
John, "and God knows to what troubles you would expose
yourself by keeping me in your family. Permit me to leave
you." Having said this, he gathered up his papers, took his
Testament, pressed the hands of his benefactors, kissed the
children, and then descending the hill, bade farewell to the
smiling banks of the Severn, and departed alone&mdash;alone with
his faith. What shall he do? What will become of him?
Where shall he go? He went forth like Abraham, one thing
alone engrossing his mind:&mdash;the Scriptures shall be translated
into the vulgar tongue, and he will deposit the oracles of God
in the midst of his countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S WORKS IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Whilst a plain minister was commencing the Reformation in
a tranquil valley in the west of England, powerful reinforcements
were landing on the shores of Kent. The writings and
actions of Luther excited a lively sensation in Great Britain.
His appearance before the diet of Worms was a common
subject of conversation. Ships from the harbours of the
Low Countries brought his books to London,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and the German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>printers had made answer to the nuncio Aleander, who was prohibiting
the Lutheran works in the empire: "Very well! we shall
send them <i>to England</i>!" One might almost say that England
was destined to be the asylum of truth. And in fact, the <i>Theses</i>
of 1517, the <i>Explanation of the Lord's Prayer</i>, the books <i>against
Emser</i>, <i>against the papacy of Rome</i>, <i>against the bull of Antichrist</i>,
<i>the Epistle to the Galatians</i>, <i>the Appeal to the German nobility</i>,
and above all the <i>Babylonish Captivity of the Church</i>&mdash;all crossed
the sea, were translated, and circulated throughout the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
The German and English nations, having a common
origin and being sufficiently alike at that time in character
and civilization, the works intended for one might be read
by the other with advantage. The monk in his cell, the country
gentleman in his hall, the doctor in his college, the
tradesman in his shop, and even the bishop in his palace, studied
these extraordinary writings. The laity in particular, who
had been prepared by Wickliffe and disgusted by the avarice
and disorderly lives of the priests, read with enthusiasm the
eloquent pages of the Saxon monk. They strengthened all
hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUBLICATION OF THE PAPAL BULL.</div>

<p>The papacy was not inactive in presence of all these efforts.
The times of Gregory VII and of Innocent III, it is true, were
passed; and weakness and irresolution had succeeded to the
former energy and activity of the Roman pontificate. The
spiritual power had resigned the dominion of Europe to the
secular powers, and it was doubtful whether faith in the papacy
could be found in the papacy itself. Yet a German (Dr. Eck)
by the most indefatigible exertions had extorted a bull from the
profane Leo X,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and this bull had just reached England. The
pope himself sent it to Henry, calling upon him to extirpate the
Lutheran heresy.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The king handed it to Wolsey, and the
latter transmitted it to the bishops, who, after reading <i>the
heretic's</i> books, met together to discuss the matter.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> There was
more Romish faith in London than in the Vatican. "This
false friar," exclaimed Wolsey, "attacks submission to the clergy&mdash;that
fountain of all virtues." The humanist prelates were
the most annoyed; the road they had taken ended in an abyss,
and they shrank back in alarm. Tonstall, the friend of Erasmus,
afterwards bishop of London, and who had just returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
from his embassy to Germany where Luther had been painted
to him in the darkest colours, was particularly violent: "This
monk is a <i>Proteus</i>.... I mean an <i>atheist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> If you allow
the heresies to grow up which he is scattering with both hands,
they will choke the faith and the church will perish.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Had we
not enough of the Wickliffites&mdash;here are new legions of the
same kind!... To-day Luther calls for the abolition of
the mass; to-morrow he will ask for the abolition of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
He rejects every thing, and puts nothing in its place. What?
if barbarians plunder our frontiers, we punish them ...
and shall we bear with heretics who plunder our altars?...
No! by the mortal agony that Christ endured, I entreat
you.... What am I saying? the whole church conjures
you to combat against this devouring <i>dragon</i>.... to
punish this <i>hell-dog</i>, to silence his sinister howlings, and to drive
him shamefully back into his den."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Thus spoke the eloquent
Tonstall; nor was Wolsey far behind him. The only attachment
at all respectable in this man was that which he entertained for
the church; it may perhaps be called respectable, for it was the
only one that did not exclusively regard himself. On the 14th
May 1521, this English pope, in imitation of the Italian pope,
issued his bull against Luther.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SARCASMS OF THE PEOPLE.</div>

<p>It was read (probably on the first Sunday in June) in all the
churches during high mass, when the congregation was most
numerous.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> A priest exclaimed: "For every book of Martin
Luther's found in your possession within fifteen days after this
injunction, you will incur the greater excommunication." Then
a public notary, holding the pope's bull in his hand, with a description
of Luther's <i>perverse opinions</i>, proceeded towards the
principal door of the church and fastened up the document.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
The people gathered round it; the most competent person read
it aloud, while the rest listened; and the following are some of

<p>The cardinal-legate, accompanied by the nuncio, by the ambassador
of Charles V, and by several bishops, proceeded in
great pomp to St. Paul's, where the bishop of Rochester
preached, and Wolsey burnt Luther's books.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> But they were
hardly reduced to ashes, before sarcasms and jests were heard
in every direction. "<i>Fire</i> is not a theological argument," said
one. "The papists, who accuse Martin Luther of slaying and
murdering Christians," added another, "are like the pickpocket,
who began to cry <i>stop thief</i>, as soon as he saw himself in danger
of being caught." "The bishop of Rochester," said a third,
"concludes that because Luther has thrown the pope's decretals
into the fire, he would throw in the pope himself....
We may hence deduce another syllogism, quite as sound: The
popes have burnt the New Testament, therefore, if they could,
they would burn Christ himself."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> These jests were rapidly
circulated from mouth to mouth. It was not enough that Luther's
writings were in England, they must needs be known,
and the priests took upon themselves to advertise them. The
Reformation was advancing, and Rome herself pushed behind
the car.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY WRITES AGAINST LUTHER.</div>

<p>The cardinal saw that something more was required than
these paper <i>autos-da-fé</i>, and the activity he displayed may indicate
what he would have done in Europe, if ever he had reached
the pontifical chair. "The spirit of Satan left him no repose,"
says the papist Sanders.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Some action out of the ordinary
course is needful, thought Wolsey. Kings have hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the enemies of the popes: a king shall now undertake their defence.
Princes are not very anxious about learning, a prince
shall publish a book!... "Sire," said he to the king, to
get Henry in the vein, "you ought to write to the princes of
Germany on the subject of this heresy." He did so. Writing
to the Archduke Palatine, he said: "This fire, which has been
kindled by Luther, and fanned by the arts of the devil, is raging
every where. If Luther does not repent, deliver him and his
audacious treatises to the flames. I offer you my royal co-operation,
and even, if necessary, my life."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> This was the first
time Henry showed that cruel thirst, which was in after days to
be quenched in the blood of his wives and friends.</p>

<p>The king having taken the first step, it was not difficult for
Wolsey to induce him to take another. To defend the honour
of Thomas Aquinas, to stand forward as the champion of the
church, and to obtain from the pope a title equivalent to that
of <i>Christianissimus</i>, most Christian king, were more than sufficient
motives to induce Henry to break a lance with Luther.
"I will combat with the pen this Cerberus, sprung from the
depths of hell,"<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> said he, "and if he refuses to retract, the fire
shall consume the heretic and his heresies together."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>The king shut himself up in his library: all the scholastic
tastes with which his youth had been imbued were revived; he
worked as if he were archbishop of Canterbury, and not king of
England; with the pope's permission he read Luther's writings;
he ransacked Thomas Aquinas; forged, with infinite labour, the
arrows with which he hoped to pierce the heretic; called several
learned men to his aid, and at last published his book. His
first words were a cry of alarm. "Beware of the track of this
serpent," said he to his Christian readers; "walk on tiptoe; fear
the thickets and caves in which he lies concealed, and whence
he will dart his poison on you. If he licks you, be careful! the
cunning viper caresses only that he may bite!"<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> After that
Henry sounded a charge: "Be of good cheer! Filled with the
same valour that you would display against Turks, Saracens, and
other infidels, march now against this <i>little friar</i>,&mdash;a fellow
apparently weak, but more formidable through the spirit that
animates him than all infidels, Saracens, and Turks put together."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
Thus did Henry VIII, the <i>Peter the Hermit</i> of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
century, preach a crusade against Luther, in order to save the
papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRUDENCE OF MORE.</div>

<p>He had skilfully chosen the ground on which he gave battle:
sacramentalism and tradition are in fact the two essential features
of the papal religion; just as a lively faith and Holy Scripture
are of the religion of the Gospel. Henry did a service to
the Reformation, by pointing out the principles it would mainly
have to combat; and by furnishing Luther with an opportunity
of establishing the authority of the Bible, he made him take a
most important step in the path of reform. "If a teaching is
opposed to Scripture," said the Reformer, "whatever be its
origin&mdash;traditions, custom, kings, Thomists, sophists, Satan, or
even an angel from heaven,&mdash;all from whom it proceeds must
be accursed. <i>Nothing can exist contrary to Scripture</i>, and every
thing must exist for it."</p>

<p>Henry's book being terminated by the aid of the bishop of
Rochester, the king showed it to Sir Thomas More, who begged
him to pronounce less decidedly in favour of the papal supremacy.
"I will not change a word," replied the king, full of servile devotion
to the popedom. "Besides, I have my reasons," and he
whispered them in More's ear.</p>

<p>Doctor Clarke, ambassador from England at the court of
Rome, was commissioned to present the pope with a magnificently
bound copy of the king's work. "The glory of England,"
said he, "is to be in the foremost rank among the nations in
obedience to the papacy."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Happily Britain was ere long to
know a glory of a very different kind. The ambassador added
that his master, after having refuted Luther's errors with the
<i>pen</i>, was ready to combat his adherents with the <i>sword</i>.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The
pope, touched with this offer, gave him his foot, and then his
cheek to kiss, and said to him: "I will do for your Master's
book as much as the church has done for the works of St.
Jerome and St. Augustine."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.</div>

<p>The enfeebled papacy had neither the power of intelligence,
nor even of fanaticism. It still maintained its pretensions and
its pomp, but it resembled the corpses of the mighty ones of
the earth that lie in state, clad in their most magnificent robes:
splendour above, death and corruption below. The thunder-bolts
of a Hildebrand ceasing to produce their effect, Rome
gratefully accepted the defence of laymen, such as Henry VIII
and Sir Thomas More, without disdaining their judicial sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and their scaffolds. "We must honour those noble champions,"
said the pope to his cardinals, "who show themselves prepared
to cut off with the sword the rotten members of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
What title shall we give to the virtuous king of England?"&mdash;<i>Protector
of the Roman church</i>, suggested one; <i>Apostolic king</i>,
said another; and finally, but not without some opposition, Henry
VIII was proclaimed <i>Defender of the Faith</i>. At the same time
the pope promised ten years' indulgence to all readers of the
king's book. This was a lure after the fashion of the middle
ages, and which never failed in its effect. The clergy compared
its author to the wisest of kings; and the book, of which many
thousand copies were printed, filled the Christian world (Cochl&oelig;us
tells us) with admiration and delight.</p>

<p>Nothing could equal Henry's joy. "His majesty," said the
vicar of Croydon, "would not exchange that name for all London
and twenty miles round."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The king's fool, entering the
room just as his master had received the bull, asked him the
cause of his transports. "The pope has just named me <i>Defender
of the Faith</i>!"&mdash;"Ho! ho! good Harry," replied the fool, "let
you and me defend one another; but ... take my word for
it ... <i>let the faith alone to defend itself</i>."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> An entire modern
system was found in those words. In the midst of the general
intoxication, the fool was the only sensible person. But Henry
could listen to nothing. Seated on an elevated throne, with the
cardinal at his right hand, he caused the pope's letter to be read
in public. The trumpets sounded: Wolsey said Mass; the king
and his court took their seats around a sumptuous table, and
the heralds at arms proclaimed: <i>Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ
et Franciæ, Defensor Fidei et Dominus Hiberniæ!</i></p>

<p>Thus was the king of England more than ever united to the
pope: whoever brings the Holy Scriptures into his kingdom
shall there encounter that material sword, <i>ferrum et materialem
gladium</i>, in which the papacy so much delighted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Wolsey's Machinations to obtain the Tiara&mdash;He gains Charles V&mdash;Alliance
between Henry and Charles&mdash;Wolsey offers to command the
Troops&mdash;Treaty of Bruges&mdash;Henry believes himself King of France&mdash;Victories
of Francis I&mdash;Death of Leo X.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY DESIRES THE TIARA.</div>

<p>One thing only was wanting to check more surely the progress
of the Gospel: Wolsey's accession to the pontifical throne.
Consumed by the desire of reaching "the summit of sacerdotal
unity,"<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> he formed, to attain this end, one of the most perfidious
schemes ambition ever engendered. He thought with others:
"The end justifies the means."</p>

<p>The cardinal could only attain the popedom through the emperor
or the king of France; for then, as now, it was the secular
powers that really elected the chief of catholicity. After carefully
weighing the influence of these two princes, Wolsey found
that the balance inclined to the side of Charles, and his choice
was made. A close intimacy of long standing united him to
Francis I, but that mattered little; he must betray his friend to
gain his friend's rival.</p>

<p>But this was no easy matter. Henry was dissatisfied with
Charles the Fifth.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Wolsey was therefore obliged to employ
every imaginable delicacy in his man&oelig;uvres. First he sent Sir
Richard Wingfield to the emperor; then he wrote a flattering
letter in Henry's name to the princess-regent of the Low Countries.
The difficulty was to get the king to sign it. "Have
the goodness to put your name," said Wolsey, "even if it should
annoy your Highness.... You know very well ... that
women like to be pleased."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> This argument prevailed with the
king, who still possessed a spirit of gallantry. Lastly, Wolsey
being named arbitrator between Charles and Francis, resolved
to depart for Calais, apparently to hear the complaints of the
two princes; but in reality to betray one of them. Wolsey
felt as much pleasure in such practices, as Francis in giving
battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S PROMISES.</div>

<p>The king of France rejected his arbitration: he had a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
eye, and his mother one still sharper. "Your master loves me
not," said he to Charles's ambassador, "and I do not love him
any more, and am determined to be his enemy."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> It was impossible
to speak more plainly. Far from imitating this frankness,
the politic Charles endeavoured to gain Wolsey, and
Wolsey, who was eager to sell himself, adroitly hinted at what
price he might be bought. "If the king of England sides with
me," Charles informed the cardinal, "you shall be elected pope
at the death of Leo X."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Francis, betrayed by Wolsey, abandoned
by the pope, and threatened by the emperor, determined
at last to accept Henry's mediation.</p>

<p>But Charles was now thinking of very different matters. Instead
of a mediation, he demanded of the king of England 4000
of his famous bowmen. Henry smiled as he read the despatch
and looking at Pace his secretary, and Marney the captain of
his guards, he said: "<i>Beati qui audiunt et non intelligunt!</i>"
thus forbidding them to understand, and above all to bruit
abroad this strange request. It was agreed to raise the number
of archers to 6000; and the cardinal, having the tiara continually
before his eyes, departed to perform at Calais the odious
comedy of a hypocritical arbitration. Being detained at
Dover by contrary winds, the mediator took advantage of this
delay to draw up a list of the 6000 archers and their captains,
not forgetting to insert in it, "certain obstinate deer," as
Henry had said, "that must of necessity be hunted down."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
These were some gentlemen whom the king desired to get
rid of.</p>

<p>While the ambassadors of the king of France were received
at Calais on the 4th of August with great honours, by the lord
high chamberlain of England, the cardinal signed a convention
with Charles's ministers that Henry should withdraw his promise
of the Princess Mary's hand to the dauphin, and give her to
the emperor. At the same time he issued orders to destroy
the French navy, and to invade France.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> And finally he procured
by way of compensating England for the pension of
16,000 pounds hitherto received from the court of St. Germains,
that the emperor should pay henceforward the annual sum of
40,000 marks. Without ready money the bargain would not
have been a good one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TREATY OF BRUGES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>This was not all. While Wolsey was waiting to be elected
pope, he conceived the idea of becoming a soldier. A commander
was wanted for the 6000 archers Henry was sending
against the king of France; and why should he not be the cardinal
himself? He immediately intrigued to get the noblemen
set aside who had been proposed as generals in chief. "Shrewsbury,"
he said to the king, "is wanted for Scotland&mdash;Worcester
by his experience is worthy that ... you should keep him
near you. As for Dorset ... he will be very dear." Then
the priest added: "Sire, if during my sojourn on the other side
of the sea, you have good reason to send your archers.... I
hasten to inform you that whenever the emperor takes the command
of his soldiers, I am ready, although an ecclesiastic,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> to
put myself at the head of yours." What devotedness! Wolsey
would cause his cross of cardinal <i>a latere</i> to be carried before
him (he said); and neither Francis nor Bayard would be able
to resist him. To command at the same time the state, the
church, and the army, while awaiting the tiara,&mdash;to surround
his head with laurels: such was this man's ambition. Unfortunately
for him, they were not of that opinion at court. The
king made the earl of Essex commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>As Wolsey could not be general, he turned to diplomacy.
He hastened to Bruges; and as he entered at the emperor's side,
a voice was heard above the crowd, exclaiming: <i>Salve, Rex regis
tui atque regni sui!</i><a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>&mdash;a sound most pleasing to his ears. People
were very much astonished at Bruges by the intimacy existing
between the cardinal and the emperor. "There is some mystery
beneath it all," they said.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Wolsey desired to place the crown
of France on Henry's head, and the tiara on his own. Such
was the mystery, which was well worth a few civilities to
the mighty Charles V. The alliance was concluded, and the
contracting parties agreed "to avenge the insults offered to
the throne of Jesus Christ," or in other words, to the popedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S PRACTICES.</div>

<p>Wolsey, in order to drag Henry into the intrigues which were
to procure him the tiara, had reminded him that he was <i>king
of France</i>, and the suggestion had been eagerly caught at. At
midnight on the 7th of August, the king dictated to his secretary
a letter for Wolsey containing this strange expression: <i>Si
ibitis parare regi locum in regno ejus hereditario, Majestas ejus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
<i>quum tempus erit opportunum, sequetur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> The theologian who
had corrected the famous latin book of the king's against
Luther, most certainly had not revised this phrase. According
to Henry, France was his hereditary kingdom, and Wolsey was
going to prepare the throne for him.... The king could
not restrain his joy at the mere idea, and already he surpassed
in imagination both Edward III and the Black Prince. "I am
about to attain a glory superior to that which my ancestors
have gained by so many wars and battles."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Wolsey traced
out for him the road to his palace on the banks of the Seine:
"Mezières is about to fall; afterwards there is only Rheims,
which is not a strong city; and thus your grace will very easily
reach Paris."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Henry followed on the map the route he would
have to take: "Affairs are going on well," wrote the cardinal,
"the Lord be praised." In him this Christian language was a
mere official formality.</p>

<p>Wolsey was mistaken: things were going on badly. On the
20th of October 1522, Francis I whom so much perfidy had
been unable to deceive,&mdash;Francis, ambitious and turbulent, but
honest in this matter at least, and confiding in the strength of
his arms, had suddenly appeared between Cambray and Valenciennes.
The emperor fled to Flanders in alarm, and Wolsey,
instead of putting himself at the head of the army, had shielded
himself under his arbitrator's cloak. Writing to Henry, who,
a fortnight before, had by his advice excited Charles to attack
France, he said: "I am confident that your <i>virtuous mediation</i>
will greatly increase your reputation and honour throughout
Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Francis rejected Wolsey's offers, but the object
of the latter was attained. The negotiations had gained time
for Charles, and bad weather soon stopped the French army.
Wolsey returned satisfied to London about the middle of December.
It was true that Henry's triumphant entry into Paris
became very difficult; but the cardinal was sure of the emperor's
favour, and through it (he imagined) of the tiara. Wolsey had
done, therefore, what he desired. He had hardly arrived in
England, when there came news which raised him to the height
of happiness: Leo X was dead. His joy surpassed what Henry
had felt at the thought of his <i>hereditary kingdom</i>. Protected
by the powerful Charles V, to whom he had sacrificed every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thing, the English cardinal was at last on the point of receiving
that pontifical crown which would permit him to crush heresy,
and which was, in his eyes, the just reward of so many infamous
transactions.</p>

the disciples of the word of God. Desirous of carrying out
the stipulations of the convention at Bruges, he had
broken out against "the king's subjects who disturbed the

<p>In the county of Lincoln on the shores of the North Sea,
along the fertile banks of the Humber, Trent, and Witham,
and on the slopes of the smiling hills, dwelt many peaceful
Christians&mdash;labourers, artificers, and shepherds&mdash;who spent
their days in toil, in keeping their flocks, in doing good, and in
reading the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The more the gospel-light increased in

were devoid of human knowledge, but they thirsted for the
knowledge of God. Thinking they were alone the true disciples
of the Lord, they married only among themselves.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> They appeared

other's houses, and sometimes passed a whole night in reading a
portion of Scripture. If there chanced to be few books among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
them, one of the brethren, who had learnt by heart the Epistle
of St. James, the beginning of St. Luke's gospel, the sermon on
the mount, or an epistle of St. Paul's, would recite a few verses
in a loud and calm voice; then all would piously converse about
the holy truths of the faith, and exhort one another to put
them in practice. But if any person joined their meetings,
who did not belong to their body, they would all keep
silent.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Speaking much among each other, they were speechless
before those from without: fear of the priests and of the
faggot made them dumb. There was no family rejoicing
without the Scriptures. At the marriage of a daughter of
the aged Durdant, one of their patriarchs, the wedding party
met secretly in a barn, and read the whole of one of St. Paul's

<p>Although they were dumb before enemies or suspected persons,
these poor people did not keep silence in the presence of
the humble: a glowing proselytism characterized them all.
"Come to my house," said the pious Agnes Ashford to James
Morden, "and I will teach you some verses of Scripture."
Agnes was an educated woman; she could read; Morden came,
and the poor woman's chamber was transformed into a school
of theology. Agnes began: "Ye are the salt of the earth,"
and then recited the following verses.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Five times did
Morden return to Agnes before he knew that beautiful
discourse. "We are spread like salt over the various parts
of the kingdom," said this Christian woman to the neophyte,
"in order that we may check the progress of superstition
by our doctrine and our life. But," added she in alarm, "keep
this secret in your heart, as a man would keep a thief in
prison."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>As books were rare these pious Christians had established a
kind of itinerant library, and one John Scrivener was continually
engaged in carrying the precious volumes from one to another.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
But at times, as he was proceeding along the banks of the river
or through the forest glades, he observed that he was followed.
He would quicken his pace and run into some barn where the
friendly peasants promptly hid him beneath the straw, or, like
the spies of Israel, under the stalks of flax.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The bloodhounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>

who so generously harboured these evangelists cruelly expiated
the crime of charity.</p>

<p>The disappointed officers had scarcely retired from the neighbourhood
when these friends of the word of God came out of
their hiding-place, and profited by the moment of liberty to
assemble the brethren. The persecutions they suffered irritated
them against the priests. They worshipped God, read, and
sang with a low voice; but when the conversation became general,
they gave free course to their indignation. "Would you
know the use of the pope's pardons?" said one of them; "they
are to blind the eyes and empty the purse."&mdash;"True pilgrimages,"
said the tailor Geoffrey of Uxbridge, "consist in visiting
the poor and sick&mdash;barefoot, if so it please you&mdash;for these are
the little ones that are god's true image."&mdash;"Money spent in
pilgrimages," added a third, "serves only to maintain thieves
and harlots."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The women were often the most animated in
the controversy. "What need is there to go to the <i>feet</i>," said
Agnes Ward, who disbelieved in saints, "when we may go to
the <i>head</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>&mdash;"the clergy of the good old times," said the wife
of David Lewis, "used to lead the people as a hen leadeth her
chickens;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> but now if our priests lead their flocks any where, it
is to the devil assuredly."</p>

<p>Erelong there was a general panic throughout this district.
The king's confessor John Longland was bishop of Lincoln. This
fanatic priest, Wolsey's creature, took advantage of his position
to petition Henry for a severe persecution: this was the ordinary
use in England, France, and elsewhere, of the confessors of
princes. It was unfortunate that among these pious disciples of
the word, men of a cynical turn were now and then met with,
whose biting sarcasms went beyond all bounds. Wolsey and
Longland knew how to employ these expressions in arousing the
king's anger. "As one of these fellows," they said, "was busy
beating out his corn in his barn, a man chanced to pass by.
'Good morrow, neighbour,' (said the latter), 'you are hard at
it!'&mdash;'Yes,' replied the old heretic, thinking of transubstantiation,
'I am thrashing the corn out of which the priests make God
Almighty.'"<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Henry hesitated no longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BISHOP'S TRIBUNAL.</div>

<p>On the 20th October 1521, nine days after the bull on the
<i>Defender of the Faith</i> had been signed at Rome, the king, who
was at Windsor, summoned his secretary, and dictated an order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
commanding all his subjects to assist the bishop of Lincoln
against the heretics. "You will obey it at the peril of your
lives," added he. The order was transmitted to Longland, and
the bishop immediately issued his warrants, and his officers
spread terror far and wide. When they beheld them, these
peaceful but timid Christians were troubled. Isabella Bartlet,
hearing them approach her cottage, screamed out to her husband:
"You are a lost man! and I am a dead woman!"<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> This
cry was re-echoed from all the cottages of Lincolnshire. The
bishop, on his judgment-seat, skilfully played upon these poor
unhappy beings to make them accuse one another. Alas! according
to the ancient prophecy: "the brother delivered up the
brother to death." Robert Bartlet deposed against his brother
Richard and his own wife; Jane Bernard accused her own father
and Tredway his mother. It was not until after the most cruel
anguish that these poor creatures were driven to such frightful
extremities; but the bishop and death terrified them: a small
number alone remained firm. As regards heroism, Wickliffe's
Reformation brought but a feeble aid to the Reformation of
the sixteenth century; still, if it did not furnish many heroes, it
prepared the English people to love God's word above all things.
Of these humble people, some were condemned to do penance in
different monasteries; others to carry a faggot on their shoulders
thrice round the market-place, and then to stand some time
exposed to the jeers of the populace; others were fastened to a
post while the executioner branded them on the cheek with a
red-hot iron. They also had their martyrs. Wickliffe's revival
had never been without them. Four of these brethren were
chosen to be put to death, and among them the pious evangelical
<i>colporteur</i> Scrivener. By burning him to ashes, the clergy desired
to make sure that he would no longer circulate the word
of God; and by a horrible refinement of cruelty his children
were compelled to set fire to the pile that was to consume their
father.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> They stretched forth their trembling hands, held in
the strong grasp of the executioners.... Poor children!...
But it is easier to burn the limbs of Christians than
to quench the Spirit of Heaven. These cruel fires could not
destroy among the Lincolnshire peasantry that love of
the Bible which in all ages has been England's strength, far
more than the wisdom of her senators or the bravery of her
generals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY LOSES THE TIARA.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Having by these exploits gained indisputable claims to the
tiara, Wolsey turned his efforts towards Rome. Leo X, as we
have seen, was just dead (1522). The cardinal sent Pace to
Rome, instructing him to "Represent to the cardinals that by
choosing a partizan of Charles or Francis, they will incur the
enmity of one or the other of these princes, and that if they
elect some feeble Italian priest, the apostolical see must become
the prey of the strongest. Luther's revolt and the emperor's
ambition endanger the papacy. There is only one means of preventing
the threatening dangers.... It is to choose me....
Now go and exert yourself."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The conclave opened
at Rome on the 27th December, and Wolsey was proposed; but
the cardinals were not generally favourable to his election. "He
is too young," said one; "too firm," said another. "He will fix
the seat of the papacy in England and not in Rome," urged
many. He did not receive twenty votes. "The cardinals,"
wrote the English ambassador, "snarled and quarrelled with
each other; and their bad faith and hatred increased every day."
On the sixth day, only one dish was sent them; and then in
despair they chose Adrian, who had been tutor to the emperor,
and the cry was raised: <i>Papam habemus!</i></p>

<p>During all this time Wolsey was in London, consumed by
ambition, and counting the days and hours. At length a despatch
from Ghent, dated the 22nd January, reached him with
these words: "On the 9th of January, the cardinal of Tortosa
was elected!"... Wolsey was almost distracted. To gain
Charles, he had sacrificed the alliance of Francis I; there was
no stratagem that he had not employed, and yet Charles, in
spite of his engagements, had procured the election of his tutor!...
The emperor knew what must be the cardinal's anger,
and endeavoured to appease it: "The new pope," he wrote,
"is old and sickly;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> he cannot hold his office long....
Beg the cardinal of York for my sake to <i>take great care of his
health</i>."</p>

<p>Charles did more than this: he visited London in person,
under pretence of his betrothal with Mary of England, and, in
the treaty then drawn up, he consented to the insertion of an
article by virtue of which Henry VIII and the mighty emperor,
bound themselves, if either should infringe the treaty, to appear
before Wolsey and to submit to his decisions.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The cardinal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
gratified by such condescension, grew calm; and at the same
time he was soothed with the most flattering hopes. "Charles's
imbecile preceptor," they told him, "has arrived at the Vatican,
attended only by his female cook; you shall soon make your
entrance there surrounded by all your grandeur." To be certain
of his game, Wolsey made secret approaches to Francis I,
and then waited for the death of the pope.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF TYNDALE.</div>

<p>While the cardinal was intriguing to attain his selfish ends,
Tyndale was humbly carrying out the great idea of giving the
Scriptures of God to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HE PREACHES SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST.</div>

<p>After bidding a sad farewell to the manor-house of Sodbury,
the learned tutor had departed for London. This occurred
about the end of 1522 or the beginning of 1523. He had left
the university&mdash;he had forsaken the house of his protector; his
wandering career was about to commence, but a thick veil hid
from him all its sorrows. Tyndale, a man simple in his habits,
sober, daring, and generous, fearing neither fatigue nor danger,
inflexible in his duty, anointed with the Spirit of God, overflowing
with love for his brethren, emancipated from human
traditions, the servant of God alone, and loving nought but
Jesus Christ, imaginative, quick at repartee, and of touching
eloquence&mdash;such a man might have shone in the foremost ranks;
but he preferred a retired life in some poor corner, provided he
could give his countrymen the Scriptures of God. Where could
he find this calm retreat? was the question he put to himself
as he was making his solitary way to London. The metropolitan
see was then filled by Cuthbert Tonstall, who was more of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
statesman and a scholar than of a churchman, "the first of
English men in Greek and Latin literature," said Erasmus.
This eulogy of the learned Dutchman occurred to Tyndale's
memory.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> It was the Greek Testament of Erasmus that led
me to Christ, said he to himself; why should not the house of
Erasmus's friend offer me a shelter that I may translate it....
At last he reached London, and, a stranger in that crowded city,
he wandered along the streets, a prey by turns to hope and fear.</p>

<p>Being recommended by Sir John Walsh to Sir Harry Guildford,
the king's comptroller, and by him to several priests,
Tyndale began to preach almost immediately, especially at St.
Dunstan's, and bore into the heart of the capital the truth
which had been banished from the banks of the Severn. The
<i>word</i> of God was with him the basis of salvation, and the <i>grace</i>
of God its essence. His inventive mind presented the truths
he proclaimed in a striking manner. He said on one occasion:&mdash;"It
is the blood of Christ that opens the gates of heaven, and
not thy works. I am wrong.... Yes, if thou wilt have it
so, by thy good works shalt thou be saved.&mdash;Yet, understand
me well,&mdash;not by those which thou has done, but by those which
Christ has done for thee. Christ is in thee and thou in him,
knit together inseparably. Thou canst not be damned, except
Christ be damned with thee; neither can Christ be saved except
thou be saved with him."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> This lucid view of justification by
faith places Tyndale among the reformers. He did not take
his seat on a bishop's throne, or wear a silken cope; but he
mounted the scaffold, and was clothed with a garment of flames.
In the service of a crucified Saviour this latter distinction is
higher than the former.</p>

<p>Yet the translation was his chief business; he spoke to his
acquaintances about it, and some of them opposed his project.
"The teachings of the doctors," said some of the city tradesmen,
"can alone make us understand Scripture." "That is to say,"
replied Tyndale, "I must measure the <i>yard</i> by the <i>cloth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
Look here," continued he, using a practical argument, "here
are in your shop twenty pieces of stuff of different lengths....
Do you measure the yard by these pieces, or the pieces by the
yard?... The universal standard is Scripture." This comparison
was easily fixed in the minds of the petty tradesmen of
the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IS RECOMMENDED TO TONSTALL.</div>

<p>Desirous of carrying out his project, Tyndale aspired to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the bishop's chaplain;<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> his ambition was more modest than
Wolsey's. The hellenist possessed qualities which could not fail
to please the most learned of Englishmen in Greek literature:
Tonstall and Tyndale both liked and read the same authors.
The ex-tutor determined to plead his cause through the elegant
and harmonious disciple of Radicus and Gorgias: "Here is one
of Isocrates' orations that I have translated into Latin," said he
to Sir Harry Guildford; "I should be pleased to become chaplain
to his lordship the bishop of London; will you beg him to accept
this trifle. Isocrates ought to be an excellent recommendation
to a scholar; will you be good enough to add yours." Guildford
spoke to the bishop, placed the translation in his hands, and
Tonstall replied with that benevolence which he showed to
every one. "Your business is in a fair way," said the comptroller
to Tyndale; "write a letter to his lordship, and deliver
it yourself."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>Tyndale's hopes now began to be realized. He wrote his
letter in the best style, and then, commending himself to God,
proceeded to the episcopal palace. He fortunately knew one
of the bishop's officers, William Hebilthwayte, to whom he gave
the letter. Hebilthwayte carried it to his lordship, while Tyndale
waited. His heart throbbed with anxiety: shall he find
at last the long hoped for asylum? The bishop's answer might
decide the whole course of his life. If the door is opened,&mdash;if
the translator of the Scriptures should be settled in the episcopal
palace, why should not his London patron receive the truth like
his patron at Sodbury? and, in that case, what a future for the
church and for the kingdom!... The Reformation was
knocking at the door of the hierarchy of England, and the latter
was about to utter its yea or its nay. After a few moments'
absence Hebilthwayte returned: "I am going to conduct you
to his lordship." Tyndale fancied himself that he had attained
his wishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BISHOP'S REPLY.</div>

<p>The bishop was too kind-hearted to refuse an audience to a
man who called upon him with the triple recommendation of
Isocrates, of the comptroller, and of the king's old companion
in arms. He received Tyndale with kindness, a little tempered
however with coldness, as if he were a man whose acquaintanceship
might compromise him. Tyndale having made known his
wishes, the bishop hastened to reply: "Alas! my house is full.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
I have now more people than I can employ." Tyndale was discomfited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by this answer. The bishop of London was a learned
man, but wanting in courage and consistency; he gave his right
hand to the friends of letters and of the Gospel, and his left
hand to the friends of the priests; and then endeavoured to walk
with both. But when he had to choose between the two
parties, clerical interests prevailed. There was no lack of
bishops, priests, and laymen about him, who intimidated him by
their clamours. After taking a few steps forward, he suddenly
recoiled. Still Tyndale ventured to hazard a word; but the
prelate was cold as before. The humanists, who laughed at the
ignorance of the monks, hesitated to touch an ecclesiastical system
which lavished on them such rich sinecures. They accepted
the new ideas in theory, but not in practice. They were
very willing to discuss them at table, but not to proclaim them
from the pulpit; and covering the Greek Testament with applause,
they tore it in pieces when rendered into the vulgar
tongue. "If you will look well about London," said Tonstall
coldly to the poor priest; "you will not fail to meet with some
suitable employment." This was all Tyndale could obtain.
Hebilthwayte waited on him to the door, and the hellenist departed
sad and desponding.</p>

<p>His expectations were disappointed. Driven from the banks
of the Severn, without a home in the capital, what would become
of the translation of the Scriptures? "Alas!" he said; "I was
deceived ...<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> there is nothing to be looked for from the
bishops.... Christ was smitten on the cheek before the
bishop, Paul was buffeted before the bishop<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> ... and a bishop
has just turned me away." His dejection did not last long:
there was an elastic principle in his soul. "I hunger for the
word of God," said he, "I will translate it, whatever they may
say or do. God will not suffer me to perish. He never made
a mouth but he made food for it, nor a body, but he made
raiment also."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONDON MERCHANT.</div>

<p>This trustfulness was not misplaced. It was the privilege of
a layman to give what the bishop refused. Among Tyndale's
hearers at St. Dunstan's was a rich merchant named Humphrey
Monmouth, who had visited Rome, and to whom (as well as to
his companions) the pope had been so kind as to give certain
Roman curiosities, such as indulgences, <i>a culpâ et a p&oelig;nâ</i>.
Ships laden with his manufactures every year quitted London
for foreign countries. He had formerly attended Colet's preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at St. Paul's, and from the year 1515 he had known the
word of God.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> He was one of the gentlest and most obliging
men in England; he kept open house for the friends of learning
and of the Gospel, and his library contained the newest publications.
In putting on Jesus Christ, Monmouth had particularly
striven to put on his character; he helped generously with his
purse both priests and men of letters; he gave forty pounds
sterling to the chaplain of the bishop of London, the same
to the king's, to the provincial of the Augustines, and to
others besides. Latimer, who sometimes dined with him,
once related in the pulpit an anecdote characteristic of the
friends of the Reformation in England. Among the regular
guests at Monmouth's table was one of his poorest
neighbours, a zealous Romanist, to whom his generous host often
used to lend money. One day when the pious merchant was
extolling Scripture and blaming popery, his neighbour turned
pale, rose from the table, and left the room. "I will never set
foot in his house again," he said to his friends, "and I will never
borrow another shilling of him."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> He next went to the bishop
and laid an information against his benefactor. Monmouth
forgave him, and tried to bring him back; but the neighbour
constantly turned out of his way. Once, however, they met in
a street so narrow that he could not escape. "I will pass by
without looking at him," said the Romanist turning away his
head. But Monmouth went straight to him, took him by the
hand, and said affectionately: "Neighbour, what wrong have I
done you?" and he continued to speak to him with so much
love, that the poor man fell on his knees, burst into tears, and
begged his forgiveness.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Such was the spirit which, at the very
outset, animated the work of the Reformation in England: it
was acceptable to God, and found favour with the people.</p>

<p>Monmouth being edified by Tyndale's sermons, inquired into
his means of living. "I have none,"<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> replied he, "but I
hope to enter into the bishop's service." This was before his
visit to Tonstall. When Tyndale saw all his hopes frustrated,
he went to Monmouth and told him everything. "Come and
live with me," said the wealthy merchant, "and there labour."
God did to Tyndale according to his faith. Simple, frugal, devoted
to work, he studied night and day;<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and wishing to guard
his mind against "being overcharged with surfeiting," he refused
the delicacies of his patron's table, and would take nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
sodden meat and small beer.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> It would even seem that he carried
simplicity in dress almost too far.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> By his conversation and
his works, he shed over the house of his patron the mild light
of the Christian virtues, and Monmouth loved him more and
more every day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRYTH JOINS TYNDALE.</div>

<p>Tyndale was advancing in his work when John Fryth, the
mathematician of King's College, Cambridge, arrived in London.
It is probable that Tyndale, feeling the want of an associate,
had invited him. United like Luther and Melancthon, the two
friends held many precious conversations together. "I will
consecrate my life wholly to the church of Jesus Christ," said
Fryth.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> "To be a good man, you must give great part of yourself
to your parents, a greater part to your country; but the
greatest of all to the church of the Lord." "The people should
know the word of God,"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> they said both. "The interpretation
of the gospel, without the intervention of councils or popes, is
sufficient to create a saving faith in the heart." They shut
themselves up in the little room in Monmouth's house, and
translated chapter after chapter from the Greek into plain
English. The bishop of London knew nothing of the work going
on a few yards from him, and everything was succeeding to
Tyndale's wishes when it was interrupted by an unforeseen
circumstance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING AND THE SCAFFOLD.</div>

<p>Longland, the persecutor of the Lincolnshire Christians, did not
confine his activity within the limits of his diocese; he besieged
the king, the cardinal, and the queen with his cruel importunities,
using Wolsey's influence with Henry, and Henry's with
Wolsey. "His majesty," he wrote to the cardinal, "shows in
this holy dispute as much goodness as zeal ... yet, be pleased
to urge him to overthrow God's enemies." And then turning to
the king, the confessor said, to spur him on: "The cardinal is
about to fulminate the greater excommunication against all who
possess Luther's works or hold his opinions, and to make the
booksellers sign a bond before the magistrates, not to sell <i>heretical</i>
books." "Wonderful!" replied Henry with a sneer, "they
will fear the magisterial bond, I think, more than the <i>clerical</i>
excommunication." And yet the consequences of the "clerical"
excommunication were to be very positive; whosoever persevered
in his offence was to be pursued by the law <i>ad ignem</i>, even to the
fire.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> At last the confessor applied to the queen: "We cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sure of restraining the press," he said to her. "These wretched
books come to us from Germany, France, and the Low Countries;
and are even printed in the very midst of us. Madam, we must
train and prepare skilful men, such as are able to discuss the
controverted points, so that the laity, struck on the one hand
by well developed arguments, and frightened by the fear of
punishment on the other, may be kept in obedience."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> In the
bishop's system, "fire" was to be the complement of Roman
learning. The essential idea of Jesuitism is already visible in
this conception of Henry the Eighth's confessor. That system
is the natural development of Romanism.</p>

<p>Tonstall, urged forward by Longland, and desirous of showing
himself as holy a churchman as he had once been a skilful statesman
and elegant scholar&mdash;Tonstall, the friend of Erasmus, began
to persecute. He would have feared to shed blood, like Longland;
but there are measures which torture the mind and not the
body, and which the most moderate men fear not to make use
of. John Higgins, Henry Chambers, Thomas Eaglestone, a
priest named Edmund Spilman, and some other Christians in
London, used to meet and read portions of the Bible in English,
and even asserted publicly that "Luther had more learning in
his little finger than all the doctors in England."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The bishop
ordered these rebels to be arrested: he flattered and alarmed
them, threatening them with a cruel death (which he would
hardly have inflicted on them), and by these skilful practices
reduced them to silence.</p>

<p>Tyndale, who witnessed this persecution, feared lest the stake
should interrupt his labour. If those who read a few fragments
of Scripture are threatened with death, what will he not have
to endure who is translating the whole? His friends entreated
him to withdraw from the bishop's pursuit. "Alas!" he exclaimed,
"is there then no place where I can translate the
Bible?... It is not the bishop's house alone that is closed
against me, but all England."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS INDIGNATION AGAINST THE PRELATES.</div>

<p>He then made a great sacrifice. Since there is no place in
his own country where he can translate the word of God, he will
go and seek one among the nations of the continent. It is true
the people are unknown to him; he is without resources; perhaps
persecution and even death await him there.... It matters not!
some time must elapse before it is known what he is doing, and
perhaps he will have been able to translate the Bible. He turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
his eyes towards Germany. "God does not destine us to a quiet
life here below," he said.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> "If he calls us to peace on the part
of Jesus Christ, he calls us to war on the part of the world."</p>

<p>There lay at that moment in the river Thames a vessel loading
for Hamburg. Monmouth gave Tyndale ten pounds sterling
for his voyage, and other friends contributed a like amount.
He left the half of this sum in the hands of his benefactor to
provide for his future wants, and prepared to quit London,
where he had spent a year. Rejected by his fellow-countrymen,
persecuted by the clergy, and carrying with him only his New
Testament and his ten pounds, he went on board the ship, shaking
off the dust of his feet, according to his Master's precept,
and that dust fell back on the priests of England. He was
indignant (says the chronicler) against those coarse monks,
covetous priests, and pompous prelates,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> who were waging an
impious war against God. "What a trade is that of the priests!"
he said in one of his later writings; "they want money for
every thing: money for baptism, money for churchings, for
weddings, for buryings, for images, brotherhoods, penances, soul-masses,
bells, organs, chalices, copes, surplices, ewers, censers,
and all manner of ornaments. Poor sheep! The parson shears,
the vicar shaves, the parish priest polls, the friar scrapes, the
indulgence seller pares ... all that you want is a butcher to
flay you and take away your skin.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> He will not leave you
long. Why are your prelates dressed in red? Because they
are ready to shed the blood of whomsoever seeketh the word of
God.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Scourge of states, devastators of kingdoms, the priests
take away not only Holy Scripture, but also prosperity and
peace; but of their councils is no layman; reigning over all, they
obey nobody; and making all concur to their own greatness, they
conspire against every kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>No kingdom was to be more familiar than England with the
conspiracies of the papacy of which Tyndale spoke; and yet none
was to free itself more irrevocably from the power of Rome.</p>

<p>Yet Tyndale was leaving the shores of his native land, and
as he turned his eyes towards the new countries, hope revived
in his heart. He was going to be free, and he would use his
liberty to deliver the word of God, so long held captive. "The
priests," he said one day, "when they had slain Christ, set poleaxes
to keep him in his sepulchre, that he should not rise again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
even so have our priests buried the testament of God, and all
their study is to keep it down, that it rise not again.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> But the
hour of the Lord is come, and nothing can hinder the word of
God, as nothing could hinder Jesus Christ of old from issuing
from the tomb." Indeed that poor man, then sailing towards
Germany, was to send back, even from the banks of the Elbe,
the eternal Gospel to his countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY AT CAMBRIDGE.</div>

<p>This ship did not bear away all the hopes of England. A
society of Christians had been formed at Cambridge, of which
Bilney was the centre. He now knew no other canon law than
Scripture, and had found a new master, "the Holy Spirit of
Christ," says an historian. Although he was naturally timid, and
often suffered from the exhaustion brought on by his fasts and
vigils, there was in his language a life, liberty, and strength,
strikingly in contrast with his sickly appearance. He desired
to draw to the knowledge of God,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> all who came nigh him; and
by degrees, the rays of the Gospel sun, which was then rising in
the firmament of Christendom, pierced the ancient windows of
the colleges, and illuminated the solitary chambers of certain
of the masters and fellows. Master Arthur, Master Thistle of
Pembroke Hall, and Master Stafford, were among the first to
join Bilney. George Stafford, professor of divinity, was a man
of deep learning and holy life, clear and precise in his teaching.
He was admired by every one in Cambridge, so that his conversion,
like that of his friends, spread alarm among the partisans
of the schoolmen. But a conversion still more striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
than this was destined to give the English Reformation a
champion more illustrious than either Stafford or Bilney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LEICESTERSHIRE FARMER.</div>

<p>There was in Cambridge, at that time, a priest notorious for
his ardent fanaticism. In the processions, amidst the pomp,
prayers, and chanting of the train, none could fail to notice a
master-of-arts, about thirty years of age, who, with erect head,
carried proudly the university cross. Hugh Latimer, for such
was his name, combined a biting humour with an impetuous disposition
and indefatigable zeal, and was very quick in ridiculing
the faults of his adversaries. There was more wit and raillery
in his fanaticism than can often be found in such characters.
He followed the friends of the word of God into the colleges
and houses where they used to meet, debated with them, and
pressed them to abandon their faith. He was a second Saul, and
was soon to resemble the apostle of the Gentiles in another respect.</p>

<p>He first saw light in the year 1491, in the county of
Leicester. Hugh's father was an honest yeoman; and accompanied
by one of his six sisters, the little boy had often tended
in the pastures the five score sheep belonging to the farm,
or driven home to his mother the thirty cows it was her business
to milk.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> In 1497, the Cornish rebels, under Lord Audley,
having encamped at Blackheath, our farmer had donned his
rusty armour, and mounting his horse, responded to the summons
of the crown. Hugh, then only six years old, was present
at his departure, and as if he had wished to take his little part
in the battle, he had buckled the straps of his father's armour.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
Fifty-two years afterwards he recalled this circumstance to
mind in a sermon preached before king Edward. His father's
house was always open to the neighbours; and no poor man ever
turned away from the door without having received alms. The
old man brought up his family in the love of men and in the
fear of God, and having remarked with joy the precocious understanding
of his son, he had him educated in the country
schools, and then sent to Cambridge at the age of fourteen.
This was in 1505, just as Luther was entering the Augustine
convent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OBSTINATE PAPIST.</div>

<p>The son of the Leicestershire yeoman was lively, fond of
pleasure, and of cheerful conversation, and mingled frequently
in the amusements of his fellow-students. One day, as they
were dining together, one of the party exclaimed: <i>Nil melius
quam lætari et facere bene</i>!&mdash;"There is nothing better than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
be merry and to do well."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>&mdash;"A vengeance on that <i>bene</i>!"
replied a monk of impudent mien; "I wish it were beyond the
sea;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> it mars all the rest." Young Latimer was much surprised
at the remark: "I understand it now," said he; "that will
be a heavy <i>bene</i> to these monks when they have to render God
an account of their lives."</p>

<p>Latimer having become more serious, threw himself heart
and soul into the practices of superstition, and a very bigoted
old cousin undertook to instruct him in them. One day, when
one of their relations lay dead, she said to him: "Now we must
drive out the devil. Take this holy taper, my child, and pass
it over the body, first longways and then athwart, so as always
to make the sign of the cross."</p>

<p>But the scholar performing this exorcism very awkwardly,
his aged cousin snatched the candle from his hand, exclaiming
angrily: "It's a great pity your father spends so much money
on your studies: he will never make anything of you."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>This prophecy was not fulfilled. He became Fellow of Clare
Hall in 1509, and took his master's degree in 1514. His
classical studies being ended, he began to study divinity. Duns
Scotus, Aquinas, and Hugo de Sancto Victore were his favourite
authors. The practical side of things, however, engaged
him more than the speculative; and he was more distinguished
in Cambridge for his asceticism and enthusiasm than for his
learning, He attached importance to the merest trifles. As
the missal directs that water should be mingled with the sacramental
wine, often while saying mass he would be troubled in
his conscience for fear he had not put <i>sufficient water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> This
remorse never left him a moment's tranquillity during the service.
In him, as in many others, attachment to puerile ordinances
occupied in his heart the place of faith in the great truths.
With him, the cause of the church was the cause of God, and he
respected Thomas à Becket at least as much as St. Paul. "I
was then," said he, "as obstinate a papist as any in England."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
Luther said the same thing of himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STAFFORD AND THE SOPHISTS.</div>

<p>The fervent Latimer soon observed that everybody around
him was not equally zealous with himself for the ceremonies of
the church. He watched with surprise certain young members
of the university who, forsaking the doctors of the School, met
daily to read and search into the Holy Scriptures. People
sneered at them in Cambridge: "It is only the <i>sophists</i>," was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the cry; but raillery was not enough for Latimer. One day he
entered the room where these <i>sophists</i> were assembled, and
begged them to cease studying the Bible. All his entreaties
were useless. Can we be astonished at it? said Latimer to himself.
Don't we see even the tutors setting an example to these
stray sheep? There is Master Stafford, the most illustrious
professor in English universities, devoting his time <i>ad Biblia</i>, like
Luther at Wittemberg, and explaining the Scriptures according
to the Hebrew and Greek texts! and the delighted students celebrate
in bad verse the doctor,</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Qui Paulum explicuit rite et evangelium.</i><a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a><br />
</p>

<p>That young people should occupy themselves with these new
doctrines was conceivable, but that a doctor of divinity should
do so&mdash;what a disgrace! Latimer therefore determined to attack
Stafford. He insulted him<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>; he entreated the youth of
Cambridge to abandon the professor and his heretical teaching;
he attended the hall in which the doctor taught, made signs of
impatience during the lesson, and cavilled at it after leaving the
school. He even preached in public against the learned doctor.
But it seemed to him that Cambridge and England were struck
blind: true, the clergy approved of Latimer's proceedings&mdash;nay,
praised them; and yet they did nothing. To console him,
however, he was named cross-bearer to the university, and we
have already seen him discharging this duty.</p>

<p>Latimer desired to show himself worthy of such an honour.
He had left the students to attack Stafford; and he now left
Stafford for a more illustrious adversary. But this attack led
him to some one <i>that was stronger than he</i>. At the occasion of
receiving the degree of bachelor of divinity he had to deliver a
Latin discourse in the presence of the university; Latimer chose
for his subject <i>Philip Melancthon and his doctrines</i>. Had not
this daring heretic presumed to say quite recently that the
fathers of the church have altered the sense of Scripture?
Had he not asserted that, like those rocks whose various colours
are imparted to the polypus which clings to them,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> so the doctors
of the church give each their own opinion in the passages
they explain? And finally had he not discovered a new <i>touch-stone</i>
(it is thus he styles the Holy Scripture) by which we must
test the sentences even of St. Thomas?</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER HEARS BILNEY'S CONFESSION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Latimer's discourse made a great impression. At last (said
his hearers) England, nay Cambridge, will furnish a champion
for the church that will confront the Wittemberg doctors, and
save the vessel of our Lord. But very different was to be the
result. There was among the hearers one man almost hidden
through his small stature: it was Bilney. For some time he had
been watching Latimer's movements, and his zeal interested
him, though it was a zeal without knowledge. His energy was
not great, but he possessed a delicate tact, a skilful discernment
of character which enabled him to distinguish error, and to
select the fittest method for combating it. Accordingly, a
chronicler styles him "a trier of Satan's subtleties, appointed by
God to detect the bad money that the enemy was circulating
throughout the church."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Bilney easily detected Latimer's
sophisms, but at the same time loved his person, and conceived
the design of winning him to the Gospel. But how to manage
it? The prejudiced Latimer would not even listen to the evangelical
Bilney. The latter reflected, prayed, and at last planned
a very candid and very strange plot, which led to one of the
most astonishing conversions recorded in history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSOR CONVERTED.</div>

<p>He went to the college where Latimer resided. "For the
love of God," he said to him, "be pleased to hear my confession."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
The <i>heretic</i> prayed to make confession to the <i>catholic</i>:
what a singular fact! My discourse against Melancthon has no
doubt converted him, said Latimer to himself. Had not Bilney
once been among the number of the most pious zealots? His
pale face, his wasted frame, and his humble look are clear signs
that he ought to belong to the ascetics of catholicism. If he
turns back, all will turn back with him, and the reaction will
be complete at Cambridge. The ardent Latimer eagerly
yielded to Bilney's request, and the latter, kneeling before the
cross-bearer, related to him with touching simplicity the anguish
he had once felt in his soul, the efforts he had made to remove
it; their unprofitableness so long as he determined to follow the
precepts of the church, and lastly, the peace he had felt when
he believed that Jesus Christ is <i>the Lamb of God that taketh
away the sins of the world</i>. He described to Latimer the spirit
of adoption he had received, and the happiness he experienced
in being able now to call God his father.... Latimer, who
expected to receive a confession, listened without mistrust. His
heart was opened, and the voice of the pious Bilney penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
it without obstacle. From time to time the confessor would
have chased away the new thoughts which came crowding into
his bosom; but the penitent continued. His language, at once
so simple and so lively, entered like a two-edged sword. Bilney
was not without assistance in his work. A new, a strange witness,&mdash;the
Holy Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>&mdash;was speaking in Latimer's soul. He
learned from God to know God: he received a new heart. At
length grace prevailed: the penitent rose up, but Latimer remained
seated, absorbed in thought. The strong cross-bearer
contended in vain against the words of the feeble Bilney. Like
Saul on the way to Damascus, he was conquered, and his conversion,
like the apostle's, was instantaneous. He stammered
out a few words; Bilney drew near him with love, and God
scattered the darkness which still obscured his mind. He saw
Jesus Christ as the only Saviour given to man: he contemplated
and adored him. "I learnt more by this confession," he said
afterwards, "than by much reading and in many years before<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>....
I now tasted the word of God,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> and forsook the doctors of
the school and all their fooleries."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> It was not the penitent
but the confessor who received absolution. Latimer viewed
with horror the obstinate war he had waged against God; he
wept bitterly; but Bilney consoled him. "Brother," said he,
"though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow."
These two young men, then locked in their solitary chamber at
Cambridge, were one day to mount the scaffold for that divine
Master whose spirit was teaching them. But one of them before
going to the stake was first to sit on an episcopal throne.</p>

<p>Latimer was changed. The energy of his character was
tempered by a divine unction. Becoming a believer, he had ceased
to be superstitious. Instead of persecuting Jesus Christ, he became
a zealous seeker after him.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Instead of cavilling and railing,
he showed himself meek and gentle;<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> instead of frequenting
company, he sought solitude, studying the Scriptures and advancing
in true theology. He threw off the old man and put
on the new. He waited upon Stafford, begged forgiveness for
the insult he had offered him, and then regularly attended his
lectures, being subjugated more by this doctor's angelic conversation<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
than by his learning. But it was Bilney's society Latimer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
cultivated most. They conversed together daily, took frequent
walks together into the country, and occasionally rested
at a place, long known as "the heretic's hill."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY PREACHES GRACE.</div>

<p>So striking a conversion gave fresh vigour to the evangelical
movement. Hitherto Bilney and Latimer had been the most
zealous champions of the two opposite causes; the one despised,
the other honoured; the weak man had conquered the strong.
This action of the Spirit of God was not thrown away upon
Cambridge. Latimer's conversion, as of old the miracles of the
apostles, struck men's minds; and was it not in truth a miracle?
All the youth of the university ran to hear Bilney preach. He
proclaimed "Jesus Christ as He who, having tasted death, has
delivered his people from the penalty of sin."<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> While the doctors
of the school (even the most pious of them) laid most stress
upon <i>man's</i> part in the work of redemption, Bilney on the contrary
emphasized the other term, namely, <i>God's</i> part. This
doctrine of grace, said his adversaries, annuls the sacraments,
and contradicts baptismal regeneration. The selfishness which
forms the essence of fallen humanity rejected the evangelical
doctrine, and felt that to accept it was to be lost. "Many
listened with <i>the left ear</i>," to use an expression of Bilney's;
"like Malchus, having their <i>right</i> ear cut off;" and they filled
the university with their complaints.</p>

<p>But Bilney did not allow himself to be stopped. The idea of
eternity had seized on his mind, and perhaps he still retained
some feeble relic of the exaggeration of asceticism. He condemned
every kind of recreation, even when innocent. Music
in the churches seemed to him a mockery of God;<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> and when
Thurlby, who was afterwards a bishop, and who lived at Cambridge
in the room below his, used to begin playing on the
recorder, Bilney would fall on his knees and pour out his soul
in prayer: to him prayer was the sweetest melody. He prayed
that the lively faith of the children of God might in all England
be substituted for the vanity and pride of the priests. He
believed&mdash;he prayed&mdash;he waited. His waiting was not to be
in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURE OF THE MINISTRY.</div>

<p>Latimer trod in his footsteps: the transformation of his soul
was going on; and the more fanaticism he had shown for the
sacerdotal system, which places salvation in the hands of the
priest, the more zeal he now showed for the evangelical system,
which placed it in the hands of Christ. He saw that if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
churches must needs have ministers, it is not because they require
a human mediation, but from the necessity of a regular
preaching of the Gospel and a steady direction of the flock; and
accordingly he would have wished to call the servant of the
Lord <i>minister</i> (&#8017;&#960;&#951;&#961;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962; or &#948;&#953;&#8049;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#8057;ἱ&#947;&#959;&#965;), and not <i>priest</i>,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
(&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8059;&#962; or <i>sacerdos</i>.) In his view, it was not the imposition of
hands by the bishop that gave grace, but grace which authorized
the imposition of hands. He considered activity to be one
of the essential features of the Gospel ministry. "Would you
know," said he, "why the Lord chose <i>fishermen</i> to be his apostles?...
See how they watch day and night at their nets
to take all such fishes that they can get and come in their way....
So all our bishops, and curates, and vicars should
be as painful in casting their nets, that is to say, in preaching
God's word."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> He regarded all confidence in human strength as
a remnant of paganism. "Let us not do," he said, "as the
haughty Ajax, who said to his father as he went to battle: Without
the help of God I am able to fight, and I will get the victory
with mine own strength."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>The Reformation had gained in Latimer a very different man
from Bilney. He had not so much discernment and prudence
perhaps, but he had more energy and eloquence. What Tyndale
was to be for England by his writings, Latimer was to be
by his discourses. The tenderness of his conscience, the warmth
of his zeal, and the vivacity of his understanding, were enlisted
in the service of Jesus Christ; and if at times he was carried too
far by the liveliness of his wit, it only shows that the reformers
were not <i>saints</i>, but sanctified men. "He was one of the first,"
says an historian, "who, in the days of king Henry VIII, set
himself to preach the Gospel in the truth and simplicity of it."<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
He preached in Latin <i>ad clerum</i>, and in English <i>ad populum</i>.
He boldly placed the law with its curses before his hearers, and
then conjured them to flee towards the Saviour of the world.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
The same zeal which he had employed in saying mass, he now
employed in preaching the true sacrifice of Christ. He said
one day:&mdash;"If one man had committed all the sins since Adam,
you may be sure he should be punished with the same horror of
death, in such a sort as all men in the world should have suffered....
Such was the pain Christ endured....
If our Saviour had committed all the sins of the world; all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I for my part have done, all that you for your part have done,
and all that any man else hath done; if he had done all this
himself, his agony that he suffered should have been no greater
nor grievouser than it was.... Believe in Jesus Christ,
and you shall overcome death.... But, alas!" said he at
another time, "the devil, by the help of that Italian bishop, his
chaplain, has laboured by all means that he might frustrate the
death of Christ and the merits of his passion."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WORKS OF CHARITY.</div>

<p>Thus began in British Christendom the preaching of the Cross.
The Reformation was not the substitution of the catholicism of
the first ages for the popery of the middle ages: it was a revival
of the preaching of St. Paul, and thus it was that on hearing
Latimer every one exclaimed with rapture: "Of a <i>Saul</i>, God
has made him a very <i>Paul</i>."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>To the inward power of faith, the Cambridge evangelists
added the outward power of the life. Saul become Paul, the
strong, the ardent Latimer, had need of action; and Bilney, the
weak and humble Bilney, in delicate health, observing a severe
diet, taking ordinarily but one meal a-day, and never sleeping
more than four hours, absorbed in prayer and in the study of
the word, displayed at that time all the energy of charity.
These two friends devoted themselves not merely to the easy
labours of Christian beneficence; but caring little for that formal
Christianity so often met with among the easy classes, they explored
the gloomy cells of the madhouse to bear the sweet and
subtle voice of the gospel to the infuriate maniacs. They
visited the miserable lazar-house without the town, in which
several poor lepers were dwelling; they carefully tended them,
wrapped them in clean sheets, and wooed them to be converted
to Christ.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The gates of the jail at Cambridge were opened to
them,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> and they announced to the poor prisoners that word
which giveth liberty. Some were converted by it, and longed
for the day of their execution.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Latimer, afterwards bishop of
Worcester, was one of the most beautiful types of the Reformation
in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WORLDLINESS AND BRUTALITY.</div>

<p>He was opposed by numerous adversaries. In the front rank
were the priests, who spared no endeavours to retain souls.
"Beware," said Latimer to the new converts, "lest robbers
overtake you, and plunge you into the pope's prison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
purgatory."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> After these came the sons and favourites of the aristocracy,
worldly and frivolous students, who felt little disposition
to listen to the gospel. "By yeomen's sons the faith of Christ
is and hath been chiefly maintained in the church,"<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> said Latimer.
"Is this realm taught by rich men's sons? No, no; read
the chronicles; ye shall find sometime noblemen's sons which
have been unpreaching bishops and prelates, but ye shall find
none of them learned men." He would have desired a mode of
election which placed in the Christian pulpit, not the richest
and most fashionable men, but the ablest and most pious.
This important reform was reserved for other days. Lastly,
the evangelists of Cambridge came into collision with the <i>brutality</i>
of many, to use Latimer's own expression. "What need
have we of universities and schools?" said the students of this
class. The Holy Ghost "will give us always what to say."&mdash;"We
must trust in the Holy Ghost," replied Latimer, "but
not presume on it. If you will not maintain universities, you
shall have a <i>brutality</i>."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> In this manner the Reformation restored
to Cambridge gravity and knowledge, along with truth
and charity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTION SUSPENDED.</div>

<p>Yet Bilney and Latimer often turned their eyes towards Oxford,
and wondered how the light would be able to penetrate
there. Wolsey provided for that. A Cambridge master of
arts, John Clark, a conscientious man, of tender heart, great
prudence, and unbounded devotion to his duty, had been enlightened
by the word of God. Wolsey, who since 1523 had
been seeking every where for distinguished scholars to adorn
his new college, invited Clark among the first. This doctor,
desirous of bearing to Oxford the light which God had given
Cambridge, immediately began to deliver a course of divinity
lectures, to hold conferences, and to preach in his eloquent
manner. He taught every day.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Among the graduates and
students who followed him was Anthony Dalaber, a young man
of simple but profound feeling, who while listening to him had
experienced in his heart the regenerating power of the Gospel.
Overflowing with the happiness which the knowledge of Jesus
Christ imparted to him, he went to the Cardinal's college,
knocked at Clark's door, and said: "Father, allow me never to
quit you more!" The teacher, beholding the young disciple's
enthusiasm, loved him, but thought it his duty to try him:
"Anthony," said he, "you know not what you ask. My teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
is now pleasant to you, but the time will come when God
will lay the cross of persecution on you; you will be dragged
before bishops; your name will be covered with shame in the
world, and all who love you will be heart-broken on account
of you.... Then, my friend, you will regret that you ever
knew me."</p>

<p>Anthony believing himself rejected, and unable to bear the
idea of returning to the barren instructions of the priests, fell
on his knees, and weeping bitterly,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> exclaimed: "For the tender
mercy of God, turn me not away." Touched by his sorrow,
Clark folded him in his arms, kissed him, and with tears in his
eyes exclaimed: "The Lord give thee what thou askest!...
Take me for thy father, I take thee for my son."
From that hour Anthony, all joy, was like Timothy at the feet
of Paul. He united a quick understanding with tender affections.
When any of the students had not attended Clark's
conferences, the master commissioned his disciple to visit them,
to inquire into their doubts, and to impart to them his instructions.
"This exercise did me much good," said Dalaber, "and
I made great progress in the knowledge of Scripture."</p>

<p>Thus the kingdom of God, which consists not in forms, but
in the power of the Spirit, was set up in Cambridge and Oxford.
The alarmed schoolmen, beholding their most pious scholars
escaping one after another from their teaching, called the bishops
to their aid, and the latter determined to send agents to Cambridge,
the focus of the heresy, to apprehend the leaders. This
took place in 1523 or the beginning of 1524. The episcopal
officers had arrived, and were proceeding to business. The most
timid began to feel alarm, but Latimer was full of courage;
when suddenly the agents of the clergy were forbidden to go on,
and this prohibition, strange to say, originated with Wolsey;
"upon what ground I cannot imagine," says Burnet.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Certain
events were taking place at Rome of a nature to exercise great
influence over the priestly councils, and which may perhaps explain
what Burnet could not understand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S AMBITION.</div>

<p>Adrian VI died on the 14th September 1523, before the
end of the second year of his pontificate. Wolsey thought himself
pope. At length he would no longer be the favourite only,
but the arbiter of the kings of the earth; and his genius, for
which England was too narrow, would have Europe and the
world for its stage. Already revolving gigantic projects in his
mind, the future pope dreamt of the destruction of heresy in
the west, and in the east the cessation of the Greek schism, and
new crusades to replant the cross on the walls of Constantinople.
There is nothing that Wolsey would not have dared undertake
when once seated on the throne of catholicism, and the pontificates
of Gregory VII and Innocent III would have been eclipsed
by that of the Ipswich butcher's son. The cardinal reminded
Henry of his promise, and the very next day the king signed a
letter addressed to Charles the Fifth.</p>

<p>Believing himself sure of the emperor, Wolsey turned all his
exertions to the side of Rome. "The legate of England," said
Henry's ambassadors to the cardinals, "is the very man for the
present time. He is the only one thoroughly acquainted with
the interests and wants of Christendom, and strong enough to
provide for them. He is all kindness, and will share his dignities
and wealth among all the prelates who support him."</p>

<p>But Julio de' Medici himself aspired to the papacy, and as
eighteen cardinals were devoted to him, the election could not
take place without his support. "Rather than yield," said he
in the conclave, "I would die in this prison." A month passed
away, and nothing was done. New intrigues were then resorted
to: there were cabals for Wolsey, cabals for Medici. The cardinals
were besieged:</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Creeps sly intrigue.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a><br /></span>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S DISSIMULATION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>At length, on the 19th November 1523, the people collected
under their windows, shouting: "No foreign pope." After
forty-nine days debating, Julio was elected, and according to his
own expression, "bent his head beneath the yoke of apostolic
servitude."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> He took the name of Clement VII.</p>

<p>Wolsey was exasperated. It was in vain that he presented
himself before St. Peter's chair at each vacancy: a more active
or more fortunate rival always reached it before him. Master
of England, and the most influential of European diplomatists,
he saw men preferred to him who were his inferiors. This
election was an event for the Reformation. Wolsey as pope
would, humanly speaking, have tightened the cords which
already bound England so closely to Rome; but Wolsey, rejected,
could hardly fail to throw himself into tortuous paths
which would perhaps contribute to the emancipation of the
Church. He became more crafty than ever; declared to Henry
that the new election was quite in conformity with his wishes,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
and hastened to congratulate the new pope. He wrote to his
agents at Rome: "This election, I assure you, is as much to
the king's and my rejoicing, consolation, and gladness, as possibly
may be devised or imagined.... Ye shall show unto his
holiness what joy, comfort, and gladness it is both to the king's
highness and me to perceive that once in our lives it hath
pleased God of his great goodness to provide such a pastor unto
his church, as his grace and I have long inwardly desired; who
for his virtue, wisdom, and other high and notable qualities, we
have always reputed the most able and worthy person to be
called to that dignity."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> But the pope, divining his competitor's
vexation, sent the king a golden rose, and a ring to Wolsey.
"I am sorry," he said as he drew it from his finger, "that I
cannot present it to his eminence in person." Clement moreover
conferred on him the quality of legate <i>for life</i>&mdash;an office
which had hitherto been temporary only. Thus the popedom
and England embraced each other, and nothing appeared more
distant than that Christian revolution which was destined
very shortly to emancipate Britain from the tutelage of the
Vatican.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PACE'S EMBASSY.</div>

<p>Wolsey's disappointed ambition made him suspend the proceedings
of the clergy at Cambridge. He had revenge in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
heart, and cared not to persecute his fellow-countrymen merely
to please his rival; and besides, like several popes, he had a
certain fondness for learning. To send a few Lollards to prison
was a matter of no difficulty; but learned doctors ...
this required a closer examination. Hence he gave Rome a
sign of independence. And yet it was not specially against the
pope that he began to entertain sinister designs: Clement had
been more fortunate than himself; but that was no reason why
he should be angry with him.... Charles V was the
offender, and Wolsey swore a deadly hatred against him. Resolved
to strike, he sought only the place where he could inflict
the severest blow. To obtain his end, he resolved to dissemble
his passion, and to distil drop by drop into Henry's mind that
mortal hatred against Charles, which gave fresh energy to his
activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY REFORMS THE MONASTERIES.</div>

<p>Charles discovered the indignation that lay hid under Wolsey's
apparent mildness, and wishing to retain Henry's alliance,
he made more pressing advances to the king. Having deprived
the minister of a tiara, he resolved to offer the king a crown:
this was, indeed, a noble compensation! "You are king of
France," the emperor said, "and I undertake to win your kingdom
for you.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Only send an ambassador to Italy to negotiate
the matter." Wolsey, who could hardly contain his vexation,
was forced to comply, in appearance at least, with the emperor's
views. The king, indeed, seemed to think of nothing but his
arrival at St. Germain's, and commissioned Pace to visit Italy
for this important business. Wolsey hoped that he would be
unable to execute his commission; it was impossible to cross the
Alps, for the French troops blockaded every passage. But
Pace, who was one of those adventurous characters whom nothing
can stop, spurred on by the thought that the king himself
had sent him, determined to cross the <i>Col di Tenda</i>. On the
27th July, he entered the mountains, traversed precipitous
passes, sometimes climbing them on all-fours,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> and often falling
during the descent. In some places he could ride on horseback;
"but in the most part thereof I durst not either turn my horse
traverse (he wrote to the king) for all the worldly riches, nor
in manner look on my left hand, for the pronite and deepness
to the valley." After this passage, which lasted six days, Pace
arrived in Italy worn out by fatigue. "If the king of England
will enter France immediately by way of Normandy," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
constable of Bourbon to him, "I will give him leave to pluck
out both my eyes<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> if he is not master of Paris before All-Saints;
and when Paris is taken, he will be master of the whole kingdom."
But Wolsey, to whom these remarks were transmitted
by the ambassador, slighted them, delayed furnishing the subsidies,
and required certain conditions which were calculated to
thwart the project. Pace, who was ardent and ever imprudent,
but plain and straightforward, forgot himself, and in a moment
of vexation wrote to Wolsey: "To speak frankly, if you do not
attend to these things, I shall impute to your grace the loss of
the crown of France." These words ruined Henry's envoy in
the cardinal's mind. Was this man, who owed every thing to
him, trying to supplant him?... Pace in vain assured
Wolsey that he should not take seriously what he had said, but
the bolt had hit. Pace was associated with Charles in the
cruel enmity of the minister, and he was one day to feel its
terrible effects. It was not long before Wolsey was able to
satisfy himself that the service Charles had desired to render
the king of England was beyond the emperor's strength.</p>

<p>No sooner at ease on one side, than Wolsey found himself
attacked on another. This man, the most powerful among
kings' favourites, felt at this time the first breath of disfavour
blow over him. On the pontifical throne, he would no doubt
have attempted a reform after the manner of Sixtus V; and
wishing to rehearse on a smaller stage, and regenerate after his
own fashion the catholic church in England, he submitted the
monasteries to a strict inquisition, patronized the instruction of
youth, and was the first to set a great example, by suppressing
certain religious houses whose revenues he applied to his college
in Oxford. Thomas Cromwell, his solicitor, displayed much
skill and industry in this business,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> and thus, under the orders
of a cardinal of the Roman church, made his first campaign in
a war of which he was in later days to hold the chief command.
Wolsey and Cromwell, by their reforms, drew down the hatred
of certain monks, priests, and noblemen, always the very humble
servants of the clerical party. The latter accused the cardinal
of not having estimated the monasteries at their just value, and
of having, in certain cases, encroached on the royal jurisdiction.
Henry, whom the loss of the crown of France had put in a bad
humour, resolved, for the first time, not to spare his minister:
"There are loud murmurs throughout this kingdom," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to him; "it is asserted that your new college at Oxford is only
a convenient cloak to hide your malversations."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> "God forbid,"
replied the cardinal, "that this virtuous foundation at
Oxford, undertaken for the good of my poor soul, should be
raised <i>ex rapinis</i>! But, above all, God forbid that I should
ever encroach upon your royal authority." He then cunningly
insinuated, that by his will he left all his property to the king.
Henry was satisfied: he had a share in the business.</p>

<p>Events of very different importance drew the king's attention
to another quarter. The two armies, of the empire and of
France, were in presence before Pavia. Wolsey, who openly
gave his right hand to Charles V, and secretly his left to Francis,
repeated to his master: "If the emperor gains the victory,
are you not his ally? and if Francis, am I not in secret communication
with him?"<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> "Thus," added the cardinal, "whatever
happens, your Highness will have great cause to give thanks to
Almighty God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALLIANCE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND.</div>

<p>On the 24th of February 1525, the battle of Pavia was
fought, and the imperialists found in the French king's tent
several of Wolsey's letters, and in his military chest and in the
pockets of his soldiers the cardinal's corrupting gold. This alliance
had been contrived by Giovanni Gioacchino, a Genoese
master of the household to Louisa, regent of France, who passed
for a merchant of Bologna, and lived in concealment at Blackfriars.
Charles now saw what he had to trust to; but the news
of the battle of Pavia had scarcely reached England, when,
faithful in perfidy, Wolsey gave utterance to a feigned pleasure.
The people rejoiced also, but they were in earnest. Bonfires
were lighted in the streets of London; the fountains ran wine,
and the lord-mayor, attended by the aldermen, passed through
the city on horseback to the sound of the trumpet.</p>

<p>The cardinal's joy was not altogether false. He would have
been pleased at his enemy's defeat; but his victory was perhaps
still more useful to him.</p>

<p>He said to Henry: "The emperor is a liar observing neither
faith nor promise: the Archduchess Margaret is a woman of
evil life;<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Don Ferdinand is a child, and Bourbon a traitor.
Sire, you have other things to do with your money than to
squander it on these four individuals. Charles is aiming at
universal monarchy; Pavia is the first step of this throne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
if England does not oppose him, he will attain it." Joachim
having come privily to London, Wolsey prevailed upon Henry
to conclude between England and France an "<i>indissoluble peace</i>
by land and sea."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> At last then he was in a position to prove
to Charles that it is a dangerous thing to oppose the ambition
of a priest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW TAXES AND INSURRECTION.</div>

<p>This was not the only advantage Wolsey derived from the
triumph of his enemy. The citizens of London imagined that
the king of England would be in a few weeks in Paris; Wolsey,
rancorous and grasping, determined to make them pay dearly
for their enthusiasm. "You desire to conquer France," said
he; "you are right. Give me then for that purpose the sixth
part of your property; that is a trifle to gratify so noble an
inclination." England did not think so; this illegal demand
aroused universal complaint. "We are English and not French,
freemen and not slaves,"<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> was the universal cry. Henry might
tyrannize over his court, but not lay hands on his subjects
property.</p>

<p>The eastern counties rose in insurrection: four thousand men
were under arms in a moment; and Henry was guarded in his
own palace by only a few servants. It was necessary to break
down the bridges to stop the insurgents.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The courtiers complained
to the king; the king threw the blame on the cardinal;
the cardinal laid it on the clergy, who had encouraged him to
impose this tax by quoting to him the example of Joseph
demanding of the Egyptians the fifth part of their goods; and
the clergy in their turn ascribed the insurrection to the gospellers,
who (said they) were stirring up a peasant war in England,
as they had done in Germany. Reformation produces revolution:
this is the favourite text of the followers of the pope.
Violent hands must be laid upon the heretics. <i>Non pluit Deus,
duc ad christianos.</i><a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TENTERDEN STEEPLE.</div>

<p>The charge of the priests was absurd; but the people are
blind whenever the Gospel is concerned, and occasionally the
governors are blind also. Serious reasoning was not necessary
to confute this invention. "Here, by the way, I will tell you
a merry toy," said Latimer one day in the pulpit. "Master
More was once sent in commission into Kent to help to try out,
if it might be, what was the cause of Goodwin Sands and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shelf that stopped up Sandwich haven. He calleth the country
afore him, such as were thought to be men of experience, and
among others came in an old man with a white head, and one
that was thought to be little less than one hundred years old.
So Master More called the old aged man unto him, and said:
Father, tell me if you can, what is the cause of this great arising
of the sands and shelves hereabout, that stop up Sandwich
haven? Forsooth, Sir, (quoth he) I am an old man, for I am
well-nigh an hundred, and I think that Tenterden steeple is the
cause of the Goodwin Sands. For I am an old man, Sir, and I
may remember the building of Tenterden steeple, and before
that steeple was in building, there was no manner of flats or
sands." After relating this anecdote, Latimer slyly added:
"Even so, to my purpose, is preaching of God's word the cause
of rebellion, as Tenterden steeple was the cause Sandwich haven
is decayed."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>There was no persecution: there was something else to be
done. Wolsey, feeling certain that Charles had obstructed his
accession to the popedom, thought only in what manner he
might take his revenge. But during this time Tyndale also was
pursuing his aim; and the year 1525, memorable for the battle
of Pavia, was destined to be no less so in the British isles, by a
still more important victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE AT HAMBURG.</div>

<p>The ship which carried Tyndale and his MSS. cast anchor at
Hamburg, where, since the year 1521, the Gospel had counted
numerous friends. Encouraged by the presence of his brethren,
the Oxford fellow had taken a quiet lodging in one of the narrow
winding streets of that old city, and had immediately resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
his task. A secretary, whom he terms his "faithful companion,"<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
aided him in collating texts; but it was not long before
this brother, whose name is unknown to us, thinking himself
called to preach Christ in places where He had as yet never
been proclaimed, left Tyndale. A former friar-observant of
the Franciscan order at Greenwich, having abandoned the
cloister, and being at this time without resources, offered his
services to the Hellenist. William Roye was one of those men
(and they are always pretty numerous) whom impatience of the
yoke alienates from Rome without their being attracted by the
Spirit of God to Christ. Acute, insinuating, crafty, and yet
of pleasing manners, he charmed all those who had mere casual
relations with him. Tyndale banished to the distant shores of
the Elbe, surrounded by strange customs, and hearing only a
foreign tongue, often thought of England, and was impatient
that his country should enjoy the result of his labours: he accepted
Roye's aid. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark, translated
and printed at Hamburg, became, it would seem, the first
fruits to England of his great task.</p>

<p>But Tyndale was soon overwhelmed by annoyances. Roye,
who was pretty manageable while he had no money, had become
intractable now that his purse was less empty.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> What was to
be done? The reformer having spent the ten pounds he had
brought from England, could not satisfy the demands of his
assistant, pay his own debts, and remove to another city. He
became still more sparing and economical. The Wartburg, in
which Luther had translated the New Testament, was a palace
in comparison with the lodging in which the reformer of wealthy
England endured hunger and cold, while toiling day and night
to give the Gospel to the English Christians.</p>

<p>About the end of 1524, Tyndale sent the two Gospels to
Monmouth; and a merchant named John Collenbeke, having
brought him the ten pounds he had left in the hands of his old
patron, he prepared to depart immediately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE AT COLOGNE.</div>

<p>Where should he go? Not to England; he must complete
his task before all things. Could he be in Luther's neighbourhood
and not desire to see him? He needed not the Saxon
reformer either to find the truth, which he had already known
at Oxford, or to undertake the translation of the Scriptures,
which he had already begun in the vale of the Severn. But
did not all evangelical foreigners flock to Wittemberg? To
remove all doubt as to the interview of the reformers, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
be desirable perhaps to find some trace at Wittemberg<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> either
in the university registers or in the writings of the Saxon reformers.
Yet several contemporaneous testimonies seem to
give a sufficient degree of probability to this conference. Foxe
tells us: "He had an interview with Luther and other learned
men of that country."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> This must have been in the spring of
1525.</p>

<p>Tyndale, desirious of drawing nearer to his native country,
turned his eyes towards the Rhine. There were at Cologne
some celebrated printers well known in England, and among
others Quentel and the Byrckmans. Francis Byrckman had
warehouses in St. Paul's churchyard in London,&mdash;a circumstance
that might facilitate the introduction and sale of the Testament
printed on the banks of the Rhine. This providential circumstance
decided Tyndale in favour of Cologne, and thither he
repaired with Roye and his MSS. Arrived in the gloomy streets
of the city of Agrippina, he contemplated its innumerable
churches, and above all its ancient cathedral re-echoing to the
voices of its canons, and was oppressed with sorrow as he beheld
the priests and monks and mendicants and pilgrims who, from
all parts of Europe, poured in to adore the pretended relics of
the <i>three wise men</i> and of the <i>eleven thousand virgins</i>. And then
Tyndale asked himself whether it was really in this superstitious
city that the New Testament was to be printed in English.
This was not all. The Reform movement then at work in
Germany had broken out at Cologne during the feast of Whitsuntide,
and the archbishop had just forbidden all evangelical
worship. Yet Tyndale persevered, and submitting to the most
minute precautions, not to compromise his work, he took an
obscure lodging where he kept himself closely hidden.</p>

<p>Soon however, trusting in God, he called on the printer, presented
his manuscripts to him, ordered six thousand copies, and
then, upon reflection, sank down to three thousand for fear of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
seizure.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> The printing went on; one sheet followed another;
gradually the Gospel unfolded its mysteries in the English
tongue, and Tyndale could not contain himself for very joy.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
He saw in his mind's eye the triumphs of the Scriptures over
all the kingdom, and exclaimed with transport: "Whether
the king wills it or not, ere long all the people of England, enlightened
by the New Testament, will obey the Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>But on a sudden that sun whose earliest beams he had hailed
with songs of joy, was hidden by thick clouds. One day, just
as the tenth sheet had been thrown off, the printer hastened to
Tyndale, and informed him that the senate of Cologne forbade
him to continue the work. Every thing was discovered then.
No doubt Henry VIII, who has burnt Luther's books, wishes to
burn the New Testament also, to destroy Tyndale's manuscripts,
and deliver him up to death. Who had betrayed him? He
was lost in unavailing conjectures, and one thing only appeared
certain: alas! his vessel, which was moving onwards in full sail,
had struck upon a reef! The following is the explanation of
this unexpected incident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COCHLÆUS AT COLOGNE.</div>

<p>A man whom we have often met with in the course of this
history,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> one of the most violent enemies of the Reformation&mdash;we
mean Cochlæus&mdash;had arrived in Cologne. The wave of
popular agitation which had stirred this city during the Whitsuntide
holidays, had previously swept over Frankfort during
the festival of Easter; and the dean of Notre-dame, taking advantage
of a moment when the gates of the city were open, had
escaped a few minutes before the burghers entered his house to
arrest him. On arriving at Cologne, where he hoped to live
unknown under the shadow of the powerful elector, he had gone
to lodge with George Lauer, a canon in the church of the
Apostles.</p>

<p>By a singular destiny the two most opposite men, Tyndale
and Cochlæus, were in hiding in the same city; they could not
long remain there without coming into collision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUPERT'S MANUSCRIPTS.</div>

<p>On the right bank of the Rhine, and opposite Cologne, stood
the monastery of Deutz, one of whose abbots, Rupert, who lived
in the twelfth century, had said: "To be ignorant of Scripture
is to be ignorant of Jesus Christ. This is <i>the scripture of nations</i>!<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
This book of God, which is not pompous in words and
poor in meaning like Plato, ought to be set before every people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and to proclaim aloud to the whole world the salvation of all."
One day, when Cochlæus and his host were talking of Rupert,
the canon informed the dean that the <i>heretic</i> Osiander of Nuremberg
was in treaty with the abbot of Deutz about publishing
the writings of this ancient doctor. Cochlæus guessed that
Osiander was desirous of bringing forward the contemporary of
Saint Bernard as a witness in defence of the Reformation.
Hastening to the monastery he alarmed the abbot: "Intrust to
me the manuscripts of your celebrated predecessor," he said; "I
will undertake to print them and prove that he was one of us."
The monks placed them in his hands, stipulating for an early
publication, from which they expected no little renown.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Cochlæus
immediately went to Peter Quentel and Arnold Byrckman
to make the necessary arrangements. They were Tyndale's
printers.</p>

<p>There Cochlæus made a more important discovery than that
of Rupert's manuscripts. Byrckman and Quentel having invited
him one day to meet several of their colleagues at dinner,
a printer, somewhat elevated by wine, declared in his cups, (to
borrow the words of Cochlæus):<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> "Whether the king and the
cardinal of York wish it or not, all England will soon be Lutheran."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
Cochlæus listened and grew alarmed; he made inquiry,
and was informed that <i>two Englishmen</i>, learned men and skilled
in the languages, were concealed at Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> But all his efforts
to discover more proved unavailing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SECRET BETRAYED.</div>

<p>There was no more repose for the dean of Frankfort; his
imagination fermented, his mind became alarmed. "What,"
said he, "shall England, that faithful servant of the popedom,
be perverted like Germany? Shall the English, the most religious
people of Christendom,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and whose king once ennobled
himself by writing against Luther,&mdash;shall they be invaded by
heresy?... Shall the mighty cardinal-legate of York be
compelled to flee from his palace, as I was from Frankfort?"
Cochlæus continued his search; he paid frequent visits to the
printers, spoke to them in a friendly tone, flattered them, invited
them to visit him at the canon's; but as yet he dared not
hazard the important question; it was sufficient for the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to have won the good graces of the depositaries of the secret.
He soon took a new step; he was careful not to question them
before one another; but he procured a private interview with
one of them,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and supplied him plentifully with Rhine wine:&mdash;he
himself is our informant.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Artful questions embarrassed the
unwary printer, and at last the secret was disclosed. "The
New Testament," Cochlæus learnt, "is translated into English;
three thousand copies are in the press; fourscore pages in quarto
are ready; the expense is fully supplied by English merchants,
who are secretly to convey the work when printed, and to disperse
it widely through all England, before the king or the
cardinal can discover or prohibit it.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>... Thus will Britain
be converted to the opinions of Luther."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>The surprise of Cochlæus equalled his alarm;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> he dissembled;
he wished to learn, however, where the two Englishmen lay
concealed; but all his exertions proved ineffectual, and he returned
to his lodgings filled with emotion. The danger was
very great. A stranger and an exile, what can he do to oppose
this impious undertaking? Where shall he find a friend to
England, prepared to show his zeal in warding off the threatened
blow?... He was bewildered.</p>

<p>A flash of light suddenly dispelled the darkness. A person
of some consequence at Cologne, Herman Rincke, a patrician
and imperial councillor, had been sent on important business by
the Emperor Maximilian to Henry VII, and from that time
he had always shown a great attachment to England. Cochlæus
determined to reveal the fatal secret to him; but, being
still alarmed by the scenes at Frankfort, he was afraid to conspire
openly against the Reformation. He had left an aged
mother and a little niece at home, and was unwilling to do any
thing which might compromise them. He therefore crept
stealthily towards Rincke's house (as he tells us himself),<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> slipped
in secretly, and unfolded the whole matter to him. Rincke
could not believe that the New Testament in English was printing
at Cologne; however, he sent a confidential person to make
inquiries, who reported to him that Cochlæus's information was
correct, and that he had found in the printing office a large
supply of paper intended for the edition.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The patrician immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
proceeded to the senate, and spoke of Wolsey, of Henry
VIII, and of the preservation of the Romish church in England;
and that body which, under the influence of the archbishop, had
long since forgotten the rights of liberty, forbade the printer to
continue the work. Thus then there were to be no New Testaments
for England! A practised hand had warded off the blow
aimed at Roman-catholicism; Tyndale would perhaps be thrown
into prison, and Cochlæus enjoy a complete triumph.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE RESCUES HIS WORK.</div>

<p>Tyndale was at first confounded. Were so many years of
toil lost, then, for ever? His trial seemed beyond his strength.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
"They are ravening wolves," he exclaimed, "they preach to
others, Steal not, and yet they have robbed the soul of man of
the bread of life, and fed her with the shales [shells?] and cods
of the hope in their merits and confidence in their good works."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
Yet Tyndale did not long remain cast down; for his faith was of
that kind which would remove mountains. Is it not the word
of God that is imperilled? If he does not abandon himself, God
will not abandon him. He must anticipate the senate of Cologne.
Daring and prompt in all his movements, Tyndale bade Roye
follow him, hastened to the printing office, collected the sheets,
jumped into a boat, and rapidly ascended the river, carrying
with him the hope of England.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>When Cochlæus and Rincke, accompanied by the officers of
the senate, reached the printing office, they were surprised beyond
measure. The apostate had secured the abominable
papers!... Their enemy had escaped like a bird from
the net of the fowler. Where was he to be found now? He
would no doubt go and place himself under the protection of
some <i>Lutheran</i> prince, whither Cochlæus would take good care
not to pursue him; but there was one resource left. These
English books can do no harm in Germany; they must be prevented
reaching London. He wrote to Henry VIII, to Wolsey,
and to the bishop of Rochester. "Two Englishmen," said he to
the king, "like the two eunuchs who desired to lay hands on
Ahasuerus, are plotting wickedly against the peace of your
kingdom; but I, like the faithful Mordecai,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> will lay open their
designs to you. They wish to send the New Testament in
English to your people. Give orders at every seaport to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the introduction of this most baneful merchandise."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Such
was the name given by this zealous follower of the pope to the
word of God. An unexpected ally soon restored peace to the
soul of Cochlæus. The celebrated Dr. Eck, a champion of
popery far more formidable than he was, had arrived at Cologne
on his way to London, and he undertook to arouse the anger of
the bishops and of the king.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The eyes of the greatest opponents
of the Reformation seemed now to be fixed on England.
Eck, who boasted of having gained the most signal triumphs
over Luther, would easily get the better of the humble tutor
and his New Testament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE ARRIVES AT WORMS.</div>

<p>During this time Tyndale, guarding his precious bales,
ascended the rapid river as quickly as he could. He passed
before the antique cities and the smiling villages scattered along
the banks of the Rhine amidst scenes of picturesque beauty.
The mountains, glens, and rocks, the dark forests, the ruined
fortresses, the gothic churches, the boats that passed and repassed
each other, the birds of prey that soared over his head,
as if they bore a mission from Cochlæus&mdash;nothing could turn
his eyes from the treasure he was carrying with him. At last,
after a voyage of five or six days, he reached Worms, where
Luther, four years before, had exclaimed: "Here I stand, I can
do no other; may God help me!"<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> These words of the German
reformer, so well known to Tyndale, were the star that had
guided him to Worms. He knew that the Gospel was preached
in that ancient city. "The citizens are subject to fits of Lutheranism,"
said Cochlæus.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Tyndale arrived there, not as Luther
did, surrounded by an immense crowd, but unknown, and imagining
himself pursued by the myrmidons of Charles and of Henry.
As he landed from the boat he cast an uneasy glance around
him, and laid down his precious burden on the bank of the
river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE'S PRAYER.</div>

<p>He had had time to reflect on the dangers which threatened
his work. As his enemies would have marked the edition,
some few sheets of it having fallen into their hands, he took steps
to mislead the inquisitors, and began a new edition, striking out
the prologue and the notes, and substituting the more portable
<i>octavo</i> form for the original <i>quarto</i>. Peter Schæffer, the grandson
of Fust, one of the inventors of printing, lent his presses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
this important work. The two editions were quietly completed
about the end of the year 1525.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Thus were the wicked deceived: they would have deprived
the English people of the oracles of God, and <i>two</i> editions were
now ready to enter England. "Give diligence," said Tyndale
to his fellow-countrymen, as he sent from Worms the Testament
he had just translated, "unto the words of eternal life, by the
which, if we repent and believe them, we are born anew, created
afresh, and enjoy the fruits of the blood of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> In the
beginning of 1526, these books crossed the sea by way of Antwerp
or Rotterdam. Tyndale was happy; but he knew that the
unction of the Holy Ghost alone could enable the people of
England to understand these sacred pages; and accordingly he
followed them night and day with his prayers. "The scribes

it fast, so that it could neither stick nor cut.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Now, O God,
draw this sharp sword from the scabbard. Strike, wound, cut
asunder, the soul and the flesh, so that man being divided in
two, and set at variance with himself, may be in peace with thee
to all eternity!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. PAUL REVIVED.</div>

<p>While these works were accomplishing at Cologne and
Worms, others were going on at Cambridge and Oxford. On
the banks of the Rhine they were preparing the seed; in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
they were drawing the furrows to receive it. The gospel
produced a great agitation at Cambridge. Bilney, whom we
may call the father of the English Reformation, since, being the
first converted by the New Testament, he had brought to the
knowledge of God the energetic Latimer, and so many other witnesses
of the truth,&mdash;Bilney did not at that time put himself forward,
like many of those who had listened to him: his vocation
was prayer. Timid before men, he was full of boldness before
God, and day and night called upon him for souls. But while
he was kneeling in his closet, others were at work in the world.
Among these Stafford was particularly remarkable. "Paul is
risen from the dead," said many as they heard him. And in
fact Stafford explained with so much life the true meaning of
the words of the apostle and of the four evangelists,<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> that these
holy men, whose faces had been so long hidden under the dense
traditions of the schools,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> reappeared before the youth of the
university such as the apostolic times had beheld them. But it
was not only their <i>persons</i> (for that would have been a trifling
matter), it was their <i>doctrine</i> which Stafford laid before his
hearers. While the schoolmen of Cambridge were declaring to
their pupils a reconciliation which was not yet worked out, and
telling them that pardon must be purchased by the works
prescribed by the church, Stafford taught that redemption was
<i>accomplished</i>, that the satisfaction offered by Jesus Christ was
<i>perfect</i>; and he added, that popery having revived the <i>kingdom of
the law</i>, God, by the Reformation, was now reviving the <i>kingdom
of grace</i>. The Cambridge students, charmed by their master's
teaching, greeted him with applause, and, indulging a little too
far in their enthusiasm, said to one another as they left the
lecture-room: "Which is the most indebted to the other? Stafford
to Paul, who left him the holy epistles; or Paul to Stafford,
who has resuscitated that apostle and his holy doctrines, which
the middle ages had obscured?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER'S PREACHING.</div>

<p>Above Bilney and Stafford rose Latimer, who, by the power
of the Holy Ghost, transfused into other hearts the learned lessons
of his master.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Being informed of the work that Tyndale was
preparing, he maintained from the Cambridge pulpits that the
Bible ought to be read in the vulgar tongue.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> "The author of
Holy Scripture," said he, "is the mighty One, the Everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
... <i>God himself!</i>... and this Scripture partakes of the
might and eternity of its author. There is neither king nor
emperor that is not bound to obey it. Let us beware of those
bypaths of human tradition, filled of stones, brambles, and uprooted
trees. Let us follow the straight road of the word. It
does not concern us what the Fathers have done, but what they
should have done."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>A numerous congregation crowded to Latimer's preaching,
and his hearers hung listening to his lips. One in particular attracted
attention. He was a Norfolk youth, sixteen years of
age, whose features were lighted up with understanding and
piety. This poor scholar had received with eagerness the truth
announced by the former cross-bearer. He did not miss one of
his sermons; with a sheet of paper on his knees, and a pencil
in his hand, he took down part of the discourse, trusting the remainder
to his memory.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> This was Thomas Becon, afterwards
chaplain to Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury. "If I possess
the knowledge of God," said he, "I owe it (under God) to
Latimer."</p>

<p>Latimer had hearers of many sorts. By the side of those who
gave way to their enthusiasm stood men "swelling, blown full,
and puffed up like unto Esop's frog, with envy and malice
against him," said Becon;<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> these were the partizans of traditional
catholicism, whom curiosity had attracted, or whom their
evangelical friends had dragged to the church. But as Latimer
spoke a marvellous transformation was worked in them; by
degrees their angry features relaxed, their fierce looks grew
softer; and, if these friends of the priests were asked, after their
return home, what they thought of the heretic preacher, they
replied, in the exaggeration of their surprise and rapture:
"<i>Nunquam sic locutus est homo, sicut hic homo!</i>" (John
vii. 46.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY AND ANGER AT CAMBRIDGE.</div>

<p>When he descended from the pulpit, Latimer hastened to practise
what he had taught. He visited the narrow chambers of the
poor scholars, and the dark rooms of the working classes: "he
watered with good deeds whatsoever he had before planted with
godly words,"<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> said the student who collected his discourses.
The disciples conversed together with joy and simplicity of heart;
everywhere the breath of a new life was felt; as yet no external
reforms had been effected, and yet the spiritual church of
the gospel and of the Reformation was already there. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thus the recollection of these happy times was long commemorated
in the adage:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">When Master Stafford read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Master Latimer preached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was Cambridge blessed.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a><br /></span>
</div>

<p>The priests could not remain inactive: they heard speak of
grace and liberty, and would have nothing to do with either.
If <i>grace</i> is tolerated, will it not take from the hands of the
clergy the manipulation of salvation, indulgences, penance, and
all the rubrics of the canon law? If <i>liberty</i> is conceded, will not
the hierarchy, with all its degrees, pomps, violence, and scaffolds,
be shaken? Rome desires no other liberty than that of free-will,
which, exalting the natural strength of fallen man, dries up as
regards mankind the springs of divine life, withers Christianity,
and changes that heavenly religion into a human moralism and
legal observances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIOR'S SERMON.</div>

<p>The friends of popery, therefore, collected their forces to oppose
the new religion. "Satan, who never sleeps," says the
simple chronicler, "called up his familiar spirits, and sent them
forth against the reformers." Meetings were held in the convents,
but particularly in that belonging to the Greyfriars.
They mustered all their forces. <i>An eye for an eye, and a tooth
for a tooth</i>, said they. Latimer extols in his sermons the <i>blessings</i>
of Scripture; we must deliver a sermon also to show its
<i>dangers</i>. But where was the orator to be found who could
cope with him? This was a very embarrassing question to
the clerical party. Among the Greyfriars there was a haughty
monk, adroit and skilful in little matters, and full at once of
ignorance and pride: it was the prior Buckingham. No one had
shown more hatred against the evangelical Christians, and no
one was in truth a greater stranger to the Gospel. This was the
man commissioned to set forth the dangers of the word of God.
He was by no means familiar with the New Testament; he
opened it however, picked out a few passages here and there
which seemed to favour his thesis; and then, arrayed in his
costliest robes, with head erect and solemn step, already sure of
victory, he went into the pulpit, combated the heretic, and with
pompous voice stormed against the reading of the Bible;<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> it was
in his eyes the fountain of all heresies and misfortunes. "If
that heresy should prevail," he exclaimed, "there will be an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of everything useful among us. The ploughman, reading in the
gospel that <i>no man having put his hand to the plough should look
back</i>, would soon lay aside his labour.... The baker, reading
that a <i>little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</i>, will in future
make us nothing but very insipid bread; and the simple man
finding himself commanded <i>to pluck out the right eye and cast it
from thee</i>, England, after a few years, will be a frightful spectacle;
it will be little better than a nation of blind and one-eyed men,
sadly begging their bread from door to door."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>This discourse moved that part of the audience for which it
was intended. "The heretic is silenced," said the monks and
clerks; but sensible people smiled, and Latimer was delighted
that they had given him such an adversary. Being of a lively
disposition and inclined to irony, he resolved to lash the platitudes
of the pompous friar. There are some absurdities, he
thought, which can only be refuted by showing how foolish
they are. Does not even the grave Tertullian speak of things
which are only to be laughed at, for fear of giving them importance
by a serious refutation?<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> "Next Sunday I will reply to
him," said Latimer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER'S REPLY.</div>

<p>The church was crowded when Buckingham, with the hood of
St. Francis on his shoulders and with a vain-glorious air, took
his place solemnly in front of the preacher. Latimer began by
recapitulating the least weak of his adversary's arguments; then
taking them up one by one, he turned them over and over, and
pointed out all their absurdity with so much wit, that the poor
prior was buried in his own nonsense. Then turning towards
the listening crowd, he exclaimed with warmth: "This is how
your skilful guides abuse your understanding. They look upon
you as children that must be for ever kept in leading-strings.
Now, the hour of your majority has arrived; boldly examine
the Scriptures, and you will easily discover the absurdity of the
teaching of your doctors." And then desirous, as Solomon has
it, of <i>answering a fool according to his folly</i>, he added: "As for
the comparisons drawn from the <i>plough</i>, the <i>leaven</i>, and the <i>eye</i>,
of which the reverend prior has made so singular a use, is it
necessary to justify these passages of Scripture? Must I tell
you what <i>plough</i>, what <i>leaven</i>, what <i>eye</i> is here meant? Is not
our Lord's teaching distinguished by those expressions which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
under a popular form, conceal a spiritual and profound meaning?
Do not we know that in all languages and in all speeches, it is
not on the <i>image</i> that we must fix our eyes, but on the <i>thing</i>
which the image represents?... For instance," he continued,
and as he said these words he cast a piercing glance on the
prior, "if we see a fox painted preaching in a friar's hood, nobody
imagines that a fox is meant, but that craft and hypocrisy
are described, which are so often found disguised in that garb."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
At these words the poor prior, on whom the eyes of all the
congregation were turned, rose and left the church hastily, and
ran off to his convent to hide his rage and confusion among his
brethren. The monks and their creatures uttered loud cries
against Latimer. It was unpardonable (they said) to have been
thus wanting in respect to the cowl of St. Francis. But his
friends replied: "Do we not whip children? and he who treats
Scripture worse than a child, does he not deserve to be well
flogged?"</p>

<p>The Romish party did not consider themselves beaten. The
heads of colleges and the priests held frequent conferences. The
professors were desired to watch carefully over their pupils, and
to lead them back to the teaching of the church by flattery and
by threats. "We are putting our lance in rest," they told the
students; "if you become evangelicals, your advancement is at
an end." But these open-hearted generous youths loved rather
to be poor with Christ, than rich with the priests. Stafford continued
to teach, Latimer to preach, and Bilney to visit the poor:
the doctrine of Christ ceased not to be spread abroad, and souls
to be converted.</p>

<p>One weapon only was left to the schoolmen; this was persecution,
the favourite arm of Rome. "Our enterprise has not
succeeded," said they; "Buckingham is a fool. The best way
of answering these <i>gospellers</i> is to prevent their speaking." Dr.
West, bishop of Ely, was ordinary of Cambridge; they called
for his intervention, and he ordered one of the doctors to inform
him the next time Latimer was to preach; "but," added he,
"do not say a word to any one. I wish to come without being
expected."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER PREACHES BEFORE THE BISHOP.</div>

<p>One day as Latimer was preaching in Latin <i>ad clerum</i>, the
bishop suddenly entered the university church, attended by a
number of priests. Latimer stopped, waiting respectfully until
West and his train had taken their places. "A new audience,"
thought he; "and besides, an audience worthy of greater honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
calls for a new theme. Leaving, therefore, the subject I had
proposed, I will take up one that relates to the episcopal charge,
and will preach on these words: <i>Christus existens Pontifex
futurorum bonorum</i>." (Hebrews ix. 11.) Then describing
Jesus Christ, Latimer represented him as the "true and perfect
pattern unto all other bishops."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> There was not a single virtue
pointed out in the divine bishop that did not correspond with
some defect in the Romish bishops. Latimer's caustic wit had
a free course at their expense; but there was so much gravity
in his sallies, and so lively a Christianity in his descriptions,
that every one must have felt them to be the cries of a Christian
conscience rather than the sarcasms of an ill-natured disposition.
Never had bishop been taught by one of his priests
like this man. "Alas!" said many, "our bishops are not of
that breed: they are descended from Annas and Caiaphas."
West was not more at his ease than Buckingham had been
formerly. He stifled his anger, however; and after the sermon,
said to Latimer with a gracious accent: "You have excellent
talents, and if you would do one thing I should be ready to kiss
your feet."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>... What humility in a bishop!... "Preach
in this same church," continued West, "a sermon ... against
Martin Luther. That is the best way of checking heresy."
Latimer understood the prelate's meaning, and replied calmly:
"If Luther preaches the word of God, I cannot oppose him.
But if he teaches the contrary, I am ready to attack him."&mdash;"Well,
well, Master Latimer," exclaimed the bishop, "I perceive
that you smell somewhat of the pan.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>... One day or
another you will repent of that merchandise."</p>

<p>West having left Cambridge in great irritation against that
rebellious clerk, hastened to convoke his chapter, and forbade
Latimer to preach either in the university or in the diocese.
"All that will live godly shall suffer persecution," Saint Paul
had said; Latimer was now experiencing the truth of the saying.
It was not enough that the name of heretic had been given him
by the priests and their friends, and that the passers-by insulted
him in the streets; ... the work of God was violently checked.
"Behold then," he exclaimed with a bitter sigh, "the use
of the episcopal office ... to hinder the preaching of Jesus
Christ!" Some few years later he sketched, with his usual
caustic irony, the portrait of a certain bishop, of whom Luther
also used frequently to speak: "Do you know," said Latimer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
"who is the most diligentest bishop and prelate in all England?...
I see you listening and hearkening that I should name
him.... I will tell you.... It is the devil. He is never
out of his diocese; ye shall never find him out of the way; call
for him when you will, he's ever at home. He is ever at his
plough. Ye shall never find him idle, I warrant you. Where
the devil is resident&mdash;there away with books and up with
candles; away with bibles and up with beads; away with the
light of the Gospel and up with the light of candles, yea at
noondays; down with Christ's cross, up with purgatory pickpurse;
away with clothing the naked, the poor, and impotent,
up with decking of images and gay garnishing of stocks and
stones; down with God's traditions and his most holy word
Oh! that our prelates would be as diligent to sow the
corn of good doctrine as Satan is to sow cockle and darnel!"<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
Truly may it be said, "There was never such a preacher in
England as he is."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>The reformer was not satisfied with merely speaking: he
acted. "Neither the menacing words of his adversaries nor
their cruel imprisonments," says one of his contemporaries,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
"could hinder him from proclaiming God's truth." Forbidden
to preach in the churches, he went about from house to house.
He longed for a pulpit however, and this he obtained. A haughty
prelate had in vain interdicted his preaching; Jesus Christ, who
is above all bishops, is able, when one door is shut, to open
another. Instead of one great preacher there were soon two at
Cambridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROBERT BARNES.</div>

<p>An Augustine monk named Robert Barnes, a native of the
county of Norfolk, and a great scholar, had gone to Louvain to
prosecute his studies. Here he received the degree of doctor
of divinity, and having returned to Cambridge, was nominated
prior of his monastery in 1523. It was his fortune to reconcile
learning and the Gospel in the university; but by leaning too
much to learning he diminished the force of the word of God.
A great crowd collected every day in the Augustine convent to
hear his lectures upon Terence, and in particular upon Cicero.
Many of those who were offended by the simple Christianity of
Bilney and Latimer, were attracted by this reformer of another
kind. Coleman, Coverdale, Field, Cambridge, Barley, and many
other young men of the university, gathered round Barnes and
proclaimed him "the restorer of letters."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS LECTURES.</div>

<p>But the classics were only a preparatory teaching. The
masterpieces of antiquity having aided Barnes to clear the soil,
he opened before his class the epistles of St. Paul. He did not
understand their divine depth, like Stafford; he was not, like
him, anointed with the Holy Ghost; he differed from him on
several of the apostle's doctrines, on justification by faith, and
on the new creature; but Barnes was an enlightened and liberal
man, not without some degree of piety, and desirous, like
Stafford, of substituting the teaching of Scripture for the barren
disputations of the school. But they soon came into collision,
and Cambridge long remembered that celebrated discussion in
which Barnes and Stafford contended with so much renown, employing
no other weapons than the word of God, to the great
astonishment of the blind doctors, and the great joy of the clearsighted,
says the chronicler.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Barnes was not as yet thoroughly enlightened, and the friends
of the Gospel were astonished that a man, a stranger to the
truth, should deal such heavy blows against error. Bilney,
whom we continually meet with when any secret work, a work
of irresistible charity, is in hand,&mdash;Bilney, who had converted
Latimer, undertook to convert Barnes; and Stafford, Arthur,
Thistel of Pembroke, and Fooke of Benet's, earnestly prayed
God to grant his assistance. The experiment was difficult:
Barnes had reached that <i>juste milieu</i>, that "golden mean" of
the humanists, that intoxication of learning and glory, which
render conversion more difficult. Besides, could a man like
Bilney really dare to instruct the restorer of antiquity? But
the humble bachelor of arts, so simple in appearance, knew, like
David of old, a secret power by which the Goliath of the university
might be vanquished. He passed days and nights in
prayer; and then urged Barnes openly to manifest his convictions
without fearing the reproaches of the world. After many
conversations and prayers, Barnes was converted to the Gospel
of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Still, the prior retained something undecided
in his character, and only half relinquished that middle state
with which he had begun. For instance, he appears to have always
believed in the efficacy of sacerdotal consecration to transform
the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. His eye
was not single, and his mind was often agitated and driven to
and fro by contrary thoughts: "Alas!" said this divided character
one day, "I confess that my cogitations be innumerable."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p><p>Barnes, having come to a knowledge of the truth, immediately
displayed a zeal that was somewhat imprudent. Men of
the least decided character, and even those who are destined to
make a signal fall, are often those who begin their course with
the greatest ardour. Barnes seemed prepared at this time to
withstand all England. Being now united to Latimer by a
tender Christian affection, he was indignant that the powerful
voice of his friend should be lost to the church. "The bishop
has forbidden you to preach," he said to him, "but my
monastery is not under episcopal jurisdiction. You can preach
there." Latimer went into the pulpit at the Augustine's, and
the church could not contain the crowd that flocked to it. At
Cambridge, as at Wittemberg, the chapel of the Augustine
monks was used for the first struggles of the Gospel. It was
here that Latimer delivered some of his best sermons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN FRYTH.</div>

<p>A very different man from Latimer, and particularly from
Barnes, was daily growing in influence among the English reformers:
this was Fryth. No one was more humble than he,
and on that very account no one was stronger. He was less
brilliant than Barnes, but more solid. He might have penetrated
into the highest departments of science, but he was drawn
away by the deep mysteries of God's word; the call of conscience
prevailed over that of the understanding.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> He did not devote
the energy of his soul to difficult questions; he thirsted for God,
for his truth, and for his love. Instead of propagating his particular
opinions and forming divisions, he clung only to the faith
which saves, and advanced the dominion of true unity. This
is the mark of the great servant of God. Humble before the
Lord, mild before men, and even in appearance somewhat timid,
Fryth in the face of danger displayed an intrepid courage. "My
learning is small," he said, "but the little I have I am determined
to give to Jesus Christ for the building of his temple."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>Latimer's sermons, Barnes's ardour, and Fryth's firmness,
excited fresh zeal at Cambridge. They knew what was going
on in Germany and Switzerland; shall the English, ever in front,
now remain in the rear? Shall not Latimer, Bilney, Stafford,
Barnes, and Fryth do what the servants of God are doing in
other places?</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTMAS EVE, 1525.</div>

<p>A secret ferment announced an approaching crisis: every one
expected some change for better or for worse. The Evangelicals,
confident in the truth, and thinking themselves sure of victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
resolved to fall upon the enemy simultaneously on several
points. The Sunday before Christmas, in the year 1525, was
chosen for this great attack. While Latimer should address the
crowds that continued to fill the Augustine chapel, and others
were preaching in other places, Barnes was to deliver a sermon
in one of the churches in the town. But nothing compromises
the Gospel so much as a disposition turned towards outward
things. God, who grants his blessing only to undivided hearts,
permitted this general assault, of which Barnes was to be the
hero, to be marked by a defeat. The prior, as he went into
the pulpit, thought only of Wolsey. As the representative of
the popedom in England, the cardinal was the great obstacle to
the Reformation. Barnes preached from the epistle for the
day: <i>Rejoice in the Lord alway</i>.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> But instead of announcing
Christ and the joy of the Christian, he imprudently declaimed
against the luxury, pride, and diversions of the churchmen, and
everybody understood that he aimed at the cardinal. He described
those magnificent palaces, that brilliant suite, those
scarlet robes, and pearls, and gold, and precious stones, and all
the prelate's ostentation, so little in keeping (said he) with the
stable of Bethlehem. Two fellows of King's College, Robert
Ridley and Walter Preston, relations of Tonstall, bishop of
London, who were intentionally among the congregation, noted
down in their tablets the prior's imprudent expressions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERMENT IN THE COLLEGES.</div>

<p>The sermon was scarcely over when the storm broke out.
"These people are not satisfied with propagating monstrous
heresies," exclaimed their enemies, "but they must find fault
with the powers that be. To-day they attack the cardinal, to-morrow
they will attack the king!" Ridley and Preston accused
Barnes to the vice-chancellor. All Cambridge was in commotion.
What! Barnes the Augustine prior, the restorer of letters,
accused as a Lollard!... The Gospel was threatened
with a danger more formidable than a prison or a scaffold. The
friends of the priests, knowing Barnes's weakness, and even his
vanity, hoped to obtain of him a disavowal that would cover
the evangelical party with shame. "What!" said these dangerous
counsellors to him, "the noblest career was open to you,
and would you close it?... Do, pray, explain away your
sermon." They alarmed, they flattered him; and the poor prior
was near yielding to their solicitations. "Next Sunday you
will read this declaration," they said to him. Barnes ran over
the paper put into his hands, and saw no great harm in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
However he desired to show it to Bilney and Stafford. "Beware
of such weakness," said these faithful men. Barnes then
recalled his promise, and for a season the enemies of the Gospel
were silent.</p>

<p>Its friends worked with increased energy. The fall from
which one of their companions had so narrowly escaped inspired
them with fresh zeal. The more indecision and weakness Barnes
had shown, the more did his brethren flee to God for courage
and firmness. It was reported, moreover, that a powerful ally
was coming across the sea, and that the Holy Scriptures, translated
into the vulgar tongue, were at last to be given to the
people. Wherever the word was preached, there the congregation
was largest. It was the seed-time of the church; all
were busy in the fields to prepare the soil and trace the furrows.
Seven colleges at least were in full ferment: Pembroke,
St. John's, Queens', King's, Caius, Benet's, and Peterhouse. The
Gospel was preached at the Augustine's, at Saint Mary's, (the
University church,) and in other places, and when the bells rang
to prayers, the streets were alive with students issuing from the
colleges, and hastening to the sermon.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>There was at Cambridge a house called the White Horse, so
situated as to permit the most timid members of King's,
Queens', and St. John's Colleges, to enter at the rear without
being perceived. In every age Nicodemus has had his followers.
Here those persons used to assemble who desired to read the
Bible and the works of the German reformers. The priests,
looking upon Wittemberg as the focus of the Reformation,
named this house Germany: the people will always have their
bywords. At first the frequenters of the White Horse were
called sophists; and now, whenever a group of "fellows" was
seen walking in that direction, the cry was, "There are the
Germans going to Germany."&mdash;"We are not Germans," was
the reply, "neither are we Romans." The Greek New Testament
had made them Christians. The Gospel-meetings had
never been more fervent. Some attended them to communicate
the new life they possessed; others to receive what God had
given to the more advanced brethren. The Holy Spirit united
them all, and thus, by the fellowship of the saints, were real
churches created. To these young Christians the word of God
was the source of so much light, that they imagined themselves
transported to that heavenly city of which the Scriptures speak,
<i>which had no need of the sun, for the glory of God did lighten it</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
"So oft as I was in the company of these brethren," said a
youthful student of St. John's, "methought I was quietly placed
in the new glorious Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEETINGS AT OXFORD.</div>

<p>Similar things were taking place at Oxford. In 1524 and
1525, Wolsey had successively invited thither several Cambridge
fellows, and although only seeking the most able, he
found that he had taken some of the most pious. Besides John
Clark, there were Richard Cox, John Fryer, Godfrey Harman,
W. Betts, Henry Sumner, W. Baily, Michael Drumm, Th.
Lawney, and, lastly, the excellent John Fryth. These Christians,
associating with Clark, with his faithful Dalaber, and with other
evangelicals of Oxford, held meetings, like their Cambridge
brethren, at which God manifested his presence. The bishops
made war upon the Gospel; the king supported them with all
his power; but the word had gained the victory; there was no
longer any doubt. The church was born again in England.</p>

<p>The great movement of the sixteenth century had begun
more particularly among the younger doctors and students at
Oxford and Cambridge. From them it was necessary that it
should be extended to the people, and for that end the New
Testament, hitherto read in Latin and in Greek, must be circulated
in English. The voices of these youthful evangelists
were heard, indeed, in London and in the provinces; but their
exhortations would have been insufficient, if the mighty hand
which directs all things had not made this Christian activity
coincide with that holy work for which it had set Tyndale apart.
While all was agitation in England, the waves of ocean were
bearing from the continent to the banks of the Thames those
Scriptures of God, which, three centuries later, multiplied by
thousands and by millions, and translated into a hundred and
fifty tongues, were to be wafted from the same banks to the
ends of the world. If in the fifteenth century, and even in the
early days of the sixteenth, the English New Testament had
been brought to London, it would only have fallen into the
hands of a few Lollards. Now, in every place, in the parsonages,
the universities, and the palaces, as well as in the cottages
of the husbandmen and the shops of the tradesmen, there was
an ardent desire to possess the Holy Scriptures. The <i>fiat lux</i>
was about to be uttered over the chaos of the church, and light
to be separated from darkness by the word of God.</p>

<h3>THE ENGLISH NEW TESTAMENT AND THE COURT OF ROME.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Church and State essentially distinct&mdash;Their fundamental Principles&mdash;What
restores Life to the Church&mdash;Separation from Rome necessary&mdash;Reform
and Liberty&mdash;The New Testament crosses the sea&mdash;Is

<p>The Church and the State are essentially distinct. They
both receive their task from God, but that task is different in
each. The task of the church is to lead men to God; the
task of the State is to secure the earthly development of a people
in conformity with its peculiar character. There are certain
bounds, traced by the particular spirit of each nation within
which the state should confine itself; while the church, whose
limits are co-extensive with the human race, has a universal
character, which raises it above all national differences. These
two distinctive features should be maintained. A state which
aims at universality loses itself; a church whose mind and aim
are sectarian falls away. Nevertheless, the church and the
state, the two poles of social life, while they are in many respects
opposed to one another, are far from excluding each other absolutely.
The church has need of that justice, order, and
liberty, which the state is bound to maintain; but the state has
especial need of the church. If Jesus can do without kings to
establish his kingdom, kings cannot do without Jesus, if they
would have their kingdoms prosper. Justice, which is the fundamental
principle of the state, is continually fettered in its
progress by the internal power of sin; and as force can do nothing
against this power, the state requires the Gospel in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
overcome it. That country will always be the most prosperous
where the church is the most evangelical. These two communities
having thus need one of the other, we must be prepared,
whenever a great religious manifestation takes place in the
world, to witness the appearance on the scene not only of the
little ones, but of the great ones also, of the state. We must
not then be surprised to meet with Henry VIII, but let us endeavour
to appreciate accurately the part he played.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHURCH AND STATE.</div>

<p>If the Reformation, particularly in England, happened necessarily
to be mixed up with the state, with the world even, it
originated neither in the state nor in the world. There was
much worldliness in the age of Henry VIII, passions, violence,
festivities, a trial, a divorce; and some historians call that <i>the
history of the Reformation in England</i>. We shall not pass by
in silence these manifestations of the worldly life; opposed as
they are to the Christian life, they are in history, and it is not
our business to tear them out. But most assuredly they are
not the Reformation. From a very different quarter proceeded
the divine light which then rose upon the human race.</p>

<p>To say that Henry VIII, was the reformer of his people is to
betray our ignorance of his. The kingly power in England by
turns opposed and favoured the reform in the church; but it
opposed before it favoured, and much more than it favoured.
This great transformation was begun and extended by its own
strength, by the Spirit from on high.</p>

<p>When the church has lost the life that is peculiar to it, it
must again put itself in communication with its creative principle,
that is, with the word of God. Just as the buckets of a
wheel employed in irrigating the meadows have no sooner discharged
their reviving waters, than they dip again into the
stream to be re-filled, so every generation, void of the Spirit of
Christ, must return to the divine source to be again filled up.
The primitive words which created the church have been preserved
for us in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles; and the
humble reading of these divine writings will create in every age
the communion of saints. God was the father of the Reformation,
not Henry VIII. The visible world which then glittered
with such brightness; those princes and sports, those noblemen,
and trials and laws, far from effecting a reform, were calculated
to stifle it. But the light and the warmth came from heaven,
and the new creation was completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEPARATION FROM ROME NECESSARY.</div>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII a great number of citizens, priests,
and noblemen possessed that degree of cultivation which favours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the action of the holy books. It was sufficient for this divine
seed to be scattered on the well-prepared soil for the work of
germination to be accomplished.</p>

<p>A time not less important also was approaching&mdash;that in
which the action of the popedom was to come to an end. The
hour had not yet struck. God was first creating within by his
word a spiritual church, before he broke without by his dispensations
the bonds which had so long fastened England to the
power of Rome. It was his good pleasure first to give truth
and life, and then liberty. It has been said that if the pope
had consented to a reform of abuses and doctrines, on condition
of his keeping his position, the religious revolution would not
have been satisfied at that price, and that after demanding <i>reform</i>,
the next demand would have been for <i>liberty</i>. The only
reproach that can be made to this assertion is, that it is superabundantly
true. Liberty was an integral part of the Reformation,
and one of the changes imperatively required was to
withdraw religious authority from the pope, and restore it to
the word of God. In the sixteenth century there was a great
outpouring of the Christian life in France, Italy, and Spain; it
is attested by martyrs without number, and history shows that
to transform these three great nations, all that the Gospel
wanted was liberty.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> "If we had set to work two months
later," said a grand inquisitor of Spain who had dyed himself
in the blood of the saints, "it would have been too late: Spain
would have been lost to the Roman church." We may therefore
believe that if Italy, France, and Spain had had some
generous king to check the myrmidons of the pope, those three
countries, carried along by the renovating power of the Gospel,
would have entered upon an era of liberty and faith.</p>

<p>The struggles of England with the popedom began shortly
after the dissemination of the English New Testament by
Tyndale. The epoch at which we are arrived accordingly brings
in one view before our eyes both the Testament of Jesus Christ
and the court of Rome. We can thus study the men (the reformers
and the Romanists) and the works they produce, and
arrive at a just valuation of the two great principles which dispute
the possession of authority in the church.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF THE NEW TESTAMENTS.</div>

<p>It was about the close of the year 1525; the English New
Testament was crossing the sea; five pious Hanseatic merchants
had taken charge of the books. Captivated by the Holy Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
they had taken them on board their ships, hidden them
among their merchandise; and then made sail from Antwerp for
London.</p>

<p>Thus those precious pages were approaching England, which
were to become its light and the source of its greatness. The
merchants, whose zeal unhappily cost them dear, were not without
alarm. Had not Cochlæus caused orders to be sent to
every port to prevent the entrance of the precious cargo they
were bringing to England? They arrived and cast anchor; they
lowered the boat to reach the shore; what were they likely to
meet there? Tonstall's agents, no doubt, and Wolsey's, and
Henry's ready to take away their New Testaments! They
landed and soon again returned to the ship; boats passed to and
fro, and the vessel was unloaded. No enemy appeared; and no
one seemed to imagine that these ships contained so great a
treasure.</p>

<p>Just at the time this invaluable cargo was ascending the river,
an invisible hand had dispersed the preventive guard. Tonstall,
bishop of London, had been sent to Spain; Wolsey was occupied
in political combinations with Scotland, France, and the empire;
Henry VIII, driven from his capital by an unhealthy winter,
was passing the Christmas holidays at Eltham; and even the
courts of justice, alarmed by an extraordinary mortality, had
suspended their sittings. God, if we may so speak, had sent
his angel to remove the guards.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing that could stop them, the five merchants,
whose establishment was at the Steel yard in Thames Street,
hastened to conceal their precious charge in their warehouses.
But who will receive them? Who will undertake to distribute
these Holy Scriptures in London, Oxford, Cambridge, and all
England? It is a little matter that they have crossed the sea.
The principal instrument God was about to use for their dissemination
was an humble servant of Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOMAS GARRET.</div>

<p>In Honey Lane, a narrow thoroughfare adjoining Cheapside,
stood the old church of All Hallows, of which Robert Forman
was rector. His curate was a plain man of lively imagination,
delicate conscience, and timid disposition, but rendered bold by
his faith, to which he was to become a martyr. Thomas Garret,
for that was his name, having believed in the Gospel, earnestly
called his hearers to repentance;<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> he urged upon them that
works, however good they might be in appearance, were by no
means capable of justifying the sinner, and that faith alone could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
save him.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> He maintained that every man had the right to
preach the word of God;<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and called those bishops pharisees,
who persecuted christian men. Garret's discourses, at once so
quickening and so gentle, attracted great crowds; and to many of
his hearers, the street in which he preached was rightly named
Honey Lane, for there they found the <i>honey out of the rock</i>.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
But Garret was about to commit a fault still more heinous in
the eyes of the priests than preaching faith. The Hanse merchants
were seeking some sure place where they might store up
the New Testaments and other books sent from Germany; the
curate offered his house, stealthily transported the holy deposit
thither, hid them in the most secret corners, and kept a faithful
watch over this sacred library.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> He did not confine himself to
this. Night and day he studied the holy books; he held Gospel
meetings, read the word and explained its doctrines to the
citizens of London. At last, not satisfied with being at once
student, librarian, and preacher, he became a trader, and sold
the New Testament to laymen, and even to priests and monks,
so that the Holy Scriptures were dispersed over the whole realm.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
This humble and timid priest was then performing alone the
biblical work of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT MEN FOUND IN THE SCRIPTURES.</div>

<p>And thus the word of God, presented by Erasmus to the
learned in 1517 was given to the people by Tyndale in 1526.
In the parsonages and in the convent cells, but particularly in
shops and cottages, a crowd of persons were studying the New
Testament. The clearness of the Holy Scriptures struck each
reader. None of the systematic or aphoristic forms of the
school were to be found there: it was the language of human
life which they discovered in those divine writings: here a conversation,
there a discourse; here a narrative, and there a comparison;
here a command, and there an argument; here a parable,
and there a prayer. It was not all doctrine or all history; but
these two elements mingled together made an admirable whole.
Above all, the life of our Saviour, so divine and so human, had
an inexpressible charm which captivated the simple. One work
of Jesus Christ explained another, and the great facts of the
redemption, birth, death, and resurrection of the Son of God,
and the sending of the Holy Ghost, followed and completed each
other. The authority of Christ's teaching, so strongly contrasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with the doubts of the schools, increased the clearness of
his discourses to his readers; for the more certain a truth is,
the more distinctly it strikes the mind. Academical explanations
were not necessary to those noblemen, farmers, and citizens.
It is to me, for me, and of me that this book speaks, said each
one. It is I whom all these promises and teachings concern.
This <i>fall</i> and this <i>restoration</i> ... they are mine. That old
<i>death</i> and this new <i>life</i>.... I have passed through them.
That <i>flesh</i> and that <i>spirit</i>.... I know them. This <i>law</i> and
this <i>grace</i>, this <i>faith</i>, these <i>works</i>, this <i>slavery</i>, this <i>glory</i>, this
<i>Christ</i> and this <i>Belial</i> ... all are familiar to me. It is my
own history that I find in this book. Thus by the aid of the
Holy Ghost each one had in his own experience a key to the
mysteries of the Bible. To understand certain authors and
certain philosophers, the intellectual life of the reader must be
in harmony with theirs; so must there be an intimate affinity
with the holy books to penetrate their mysteries. "The man
that has not the Spirit of God," said a reformer, "does not understand
one jot or tittle of the Scripture."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Now that this condition
was fulfilled, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters.</p>

<p>Such at that period were the hermeneutics of England. Tyndale
had set the example himself by explaining many of the
words which might stop the reader. "The <i>New Testament</i>!"
we may suppose some farmer saying, as he took up the book;
"what <i>Testament</i> is that?" "Christ," replied Tyndale in his
prologue, "commanded his disciples before his death to publish
over all the world <i>his last will</i>, which is to give all his goods
unto all that repent and believe.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> He bequeaths them his
righteousness to blot out their sins&mdash;his salvation to overcome
their condemnation; and this is why that document is called the
<i>Testament</i> of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"The <i>law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i>," said a citizen of London, in his
shop; "what is that?" "They are two <i>keys</i>," answered Tyndale.
"The <i>law</i> is the key which shuts up all men under condemnation,
and the <i>Gospel</i> is the key which opens the door and
lets them out. Or, if you like it, they are two salves. The
law, sharp and biting, driveth out the disease and killeth it;
while the Gospel, soothing and soft, softens the wound and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
brings life."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Everyone understood and read, or rather devoured
the inspired pages; and the hearts of the elect (to use
Tyndale's words), warmed by the love of Jesus Christ, began to
melt like wax.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MORE'S SON-IN-LAW.</div>

<p>This transformation was observed to take place even in the
most catholic families. Roper, More's son-in-law, having read
the New Testament, received the truth. "I have no more
need," said he, "of auricular confession, of vigils, or of the invocation
of saints. The ears of God are always open to hear
us. Faith alone is necessary to salvation. I believe ...
and I am saved.... Nothing can deprive me of God's
favour."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>The amiable and zealous young man desired to do more.
"Father," said he one day to Sir Thomas, "procure for me from
the king, who is very fond of you, a license to preach. God
hath sent me to instruct the world." More was uneasy. Must
this new doctrine, which he detests, spread even to his children?
He exerted all his authority to destroy the work begun in
Roper's heart. "What," said he with a smile, "is it not sufficient
that we that are your friends should know that you are a
fool, but you would proclaim your folly to the world? Hold
your tongue: I will debate with you no longer." The young
man's imagination was struck, but his heart had not been
changed. The discussions having ceased, the father's authority
being restored, Roper became less fervent in his faith, and gradually
he returned to popery, of which he was afterwards a
zealous champion.</p>

<p>The humble curate of All Hallows having sold the New Testament
to persons living in London and its neighbourhood, and
to many pious men who would carry it to the farthest parts of
England, formed the resolution to introduce it into the University
of Oxford, that citadel of traditional catholicism. It was
there he had studied, and he felt towards that school the affection
which a son bears to his mother: he set out with his books.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
Terror occasionally seized him, for he knew that the word of
God had many deadly enemies at Oxford; but his inexhaustible
zeal overcame his timidity. In concert with Dalaber, he stealthily
offered the mysterious book for sale; many students bought
it, and Garret carefully entered their names in his register.
This was in January 1526; an incident disturbed this Christian
activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY VIII AND HIS VALET.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>One morning when Edmund Moddis, one of Henry's valets-de-chambre,
was in attendance on his master, the prince, who
was much attached to him, spoke to him, of the new books
come from beyond the sea. "If your grace," said Moddis,
"would promise to pardon me and certain individuals, I would
present you a wonderful book which is dedicated to your majesty."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
"Who is the author?" "A lawyer of Gray's Inn
named Simon Fish, at present on the continent." "What is he
doing there?" "About three years ago, Mr. Row, a fellow-student
of Gray's Inn, composed for a private theatre a drama
against my lord the cardinal." The king smiled; when his
minister was attacked, his own yoke seemed lighter. "As no
one was willing to represent the character employed to give the
cardinal his lesson," continued the valet, "Master Fish boldly
accepted it. The piece produced a great effect; and my lord
being informed of this impertinence, sent the police one night
to arrest Fish. The latter managed to escape, crossed the sea,

talked of; and, carried away by his friend's example, he composed
the book of which I was speaking to your grace." "What's
the name of it?" "<i>The Supplication of the Beggars.</i>"&mdash;"Where
did you see it?"&mdash;"At two of your tradespeople's, George Elyot
and George Robinson;<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> if your grace desires it, they shall bring
it you." The king appointed the day and the hour.</p>

<p>The book was written for the king, and every body read it
but the king himself. At the appointed day, Moddis appeared
with Elyot and Robinson, who were not entirely without fear,
as they might be accused of proselytism even in the royal
palace. The king received them in his private apartments.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
"What do you want," he said to them. "Sir," replied one of
the merchants, "we are come about an extraordinary book that
is addressed to you." "Can one of you read it to me?"&mdash;"Yes,
if it so please your grace," replied Elyot. "You may repeat
the contents from memory," rejoined the king ... "but,
no, read it all; that will be better. I am ready." Elyot began,</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW A STATE IS RUINED.</div>

<p>"To the king our sovereign lord,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most lamentably complaineth of their woeful misery, unto
your highness, your poor daily bedesmen, the wretched hideou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>s
monsters, on whom scarcely, for horror, any eye dare look; the
foul unhappy sort of lepers and other sore people, needy, impotent,
blind, lame, and sick, that live only by alms; how that
their number is daily sore increased, that all the alms of all the
well-disposed people of this your realm are not half enough to
sustain them, but that for very constraint they die for hunger.</p>

<p>"And this most pestilent mischief is come upon your said
poor bedesmen, by the reason that there hath, in the time
of your noble predecessors, craftily crept into this your realm,
another sort, not of impotent, but of strong, puissant, and counterfeit,
holy and idle beggars and vagabonds, who by all the craft
and wiliness of Satan are now increased not only into a great
number, but also into a kingdom."</p>

<p>Henry was very attentive: Elyot continued:</p>

<p>"These are not the shepherds, but the ravenous wolves going
in shepherds' clothing, devouring the flock: bishops, abbots,
priors, deacons, archdeacons, suffragans, priests, monks, canons,
friars, pardoners, and sumners.... The goodliest lordships,
manors, lands, and territories are theirs. Besides this,
they have the tenth part of all the corn, meadow, pasture, grass,
wood, colts, calves, lambs, pigs, geese, and chickens. Over and
besides, the tenth part of every servant's wages, the tenth part
of wool, milk, honey, wax, cheese, and butter. The poor wives
must be accountable to them for every tenth egg, or else she
getteth not her rights [<i>i. e.</i> absolution] at Easter....
Finally what get they in a year? Summa totalis: £430,333,
6s. 8d. sterling, whereof not four hundred years past they had
not a penny....</p>

<p>"What subjects shall be able to help their prince, that be
after this fashion yearly polled? What good Christian people
can be able to succour us poor lepers, blind, sore and lame, that
be thus yearly oppressed?... The ancient Romans had
never been able to have put all the whole world under their
obeisance, if they had had at home such an idle sort of cormorants."</p>

<p>No subject could have been found more likely to captivate the
king's attention. "And what doth all this greedy sort of sturdy
idle holy thieves with their yearly exactions that they take of
the people? Truly nothing, but translate all rule, power, lordship,
authority, obedience, and dignity from your grace unto
them. Nothing, but that all your subjects should fall into disobedience
and rebellion.... Priests and doves make foul
houses; and if you will ruin a state, set up in it the pope with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
his monks and clergy.... Send these sturdy loobies
abroad in the world to take them wives of their own, and to
get their living with their labour in the sweat of their faces....
Then shall your commons increase in riches; then
shall matrimony be much better kept; then shall not your
sword, power, crown, dignity, and obedience of your people be
translated from you."</p>

<p>When Elyot had finished reading, the king was silent, sunk
in thought. The true cause of the ruin of the state had been
laid before him; but Henry's mind was not ripe for these important
truths. At last he said, with an uneasy manner: "If a
man who desires to pull down an old wall, begins at the bottom,
I fear the upper part may chance to fall on his head."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Thus
then, in the king's eyes, Fish by attacking the priests was disturbing
the foundations of religion and society. After this
royal verdict, Henry rose, took the book, locked it up in his
desk, and forbade the two merchants to reveal to any one the
fact of their having read it to him.</p>

<p>Shortly after the king had received this copy, on Wednesday
the 2nd of February, the feast of Candlemas, a number of persons,
including the king himself, were to take part in the procession,
bearing wax tapers in their hands. During the night
this famous invective was scattered about all the streets through
which the procession had to pass. The cardinal ordered the
pamphlet to be seized, and immediately waited upon the king.
The latter put his hand under his robe, and with a smile took
out the so much dreaded work, and then, as if satisfied with
this proof of independence, he gave it up to the cardinal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPPLICATIONS OF THE SOULS IN PURGATORY.</div>

<p>While Wolsey replied to Fish by confiscation, Sir Thomas
More with greater liberality, desiring that press should reply to
press, published <i>The Supplications of the Souls in Purgatory</i>.
"Suppress," said they, "the pious stipends paid to the monks,
and then Luther's gospel will come in, Tyndale's testament will
be read, heresy will preach, fasts will be neglected, the saints
will be blasphemed, God will be offended, virtue will be mocked
of, vice will run riot, and England will be peopled with beggars
and thieves."<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The Souls in Purgatory then call the author of
the Beggars' Supplication "a goose, an ass, a mad dog." Thus
did superstition degrade More's noble genius. Notwithstanding
the abuse of the souls in purgatory, the New Testament was
daily read more and more in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUNCIL OF BISHOPS.</div>

<p>Wolsey did not stop with Fish's book. It was not that
"miserable pamphlet" only that it was necessary to hunt down;
the New Testament in English had entered the kingdom by
surprise; there was the danger. The gospellers, who presumed
to emancipate man from the priests, and put him in absolute
dependence on God, did precisely the reverse of what Rome demands.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
The cardinal hastened to assemble the bishops, and
these (particularly Warham and Tonstall, who had long enjoyed
the jests launched against superstition) took the matter seriously
when they were shown that the New Testament was circulating
throughout England. These priests believed with Wolsey, that
the authority of the pope and of the clergy was a dogma to
which all others were subordinate. They saw in the reform an
uprising of the human mind, a desire of thinking for themselves,
of judging freely the doctrines and institutions, which the nations
had hitherto received humbly from the hands of the priests.
The new doctors justified their attempt at enfranchisement by
substituting a new authority for the old. It was the New Testament
that compromised the absolute power of Rome. It
must be seized and destroyed, said the bishops. London, Oxford,
and above all Cambridge, those three haunts of heresy,
must be carefully searched. Definitive orders were issued on
Saturday, 3rd February, 1526, and the work began immediately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GARRET'S FLIGHT.</div>

<p>The first visit of the inquisitors was to Honey Lane, to the
house of the curate of All Hallows. They did not find Garret;
they sought after him at Monmouth's, and throughout the
city, but he could not be met with.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> "He is gone to Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to sell his detestable wares," the inquisitors were informed, and
they set off after him immediately, determined to burn the
evangelist and his books; "so burning hot," says an historian,
"was the charity of these holy fathers."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 6th of February, Garret was quietly selling
his books at Oxford, and carefully noting down his sales in his
register, when two of his friends ran to him exclaiming, "Fly!
or else you will be taken before the cardinal, and thence ...
to the Tower." The poor curate was greatly agitated. "From
whom did you learn that?"&mdash;"From Master Cole, the clerk of
the assembly, who is deep in the cardinal's favour." Garret,
who saw at once that the affair was serious, hastened to Anthony
Dalaber, who held the stock of the Holy Scriptures at Oxford;
others followed him; the news had spread rapidly, and those who
had bought the book were seized with alarm, for they knew by
the history of the Lollards what the Romish clergy could do.
They took counsel together. The brethren, "for so did we not
only call one another, but were indeed one to another," says
Dalaber,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> decided that Garret should change his name; that
Dalaber should give him a letter for his brother, the rector of
Stalbridge, in Dorsetshire, who was in want of a curate; and
that, once in this parish, he should seek the first opportunity of
crossing the sea. The rector was in truth a "mad papist" (it is
Dalaber's expression), but that did not alter their resolution. They
knew of no other resource. Anthony wrote to him hurriedly;
and, on the morning of the 7th of February, Garret left Oxford
without being observed.</p>

<p>Having provided for Garret's safety, Dalaber next thought of
his own. He carefully concealed in a secret recess of his chamber,
at St Alban's Hall, Tyndale's Testament, and the works of
Luther, &OElig;colampadius, and others, on the word of God. Then,
disgusted with the scholastic sophisms which he heard in that
college, he took with him the New Testament and the Commentary
on the gospel of St. Luke, by Lambert of Avignon, the
second edition of which had just been published at Strasburg,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
and went to Gloucester college, where he intended to study the
civil law, not caring to have any thing more to do with the
church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS RETURN AND IMPRISONMENT.</div>

<p>During this time, poor Garret was making his way into Dorsetshire.
His conscience could not bear the idea of being, although
for a short time only, the curate of a bigoted priest,&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
concealing his faith, his desires, and even his name. He felt
more wretched, although at liberty, than he could have been
in Wolsey's prisons. It is better, he said within himself, to confess
Christ before the judgment seat, than to seem to approve
of the superstitious practices I detest. He went forward a little,
then stopped&mdash;and then resumed his course. There was a fierce
struggle between his fears and his conscience. At length, after
a day and a half spent in doubt, his conscience prevailed; unable
to endure any longer the anguish that he felt, he retraced his
steps, returned to Oxford, which he entered on Friday evening,
and lay down calmly in his bed. It was barely past midnight
when Wolsey's agents, who had received information of his return,
arrived, and dragged him from his bed,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> and delivered him
up to Dr. Cottisford, the commissary of the university. The
latter locked him up in one of his rooms, while London and
Higdon, dean of Frideswide, "two arch papists" (as the chronicler
terms them), announced this important capture to the
cardinal. They thought popery was saved, because a poor curate
had been taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GARRET AND DALABER AT PRAYER.</div>

<p>Dalaber, engaged in preparing his new room at Gloucester
college, had not perceived all this commotion.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> On Saturday, at
noon, having finished his arrangements, he double-locked his
door, and began to read the Gospel according to St. Luke. All
of a sudden he hears a knock. Dalaber made no reply; it is no
doubt the commissary's officers. A louder knock was given;
but he still remained silent. Immediately after, there was a
third knock, as if the door would be beaten in. "Perhaps somebody
wants me," thought Dalaber. He laid his book aside,
opened the door, and to his great surprise saw Garret, who, with
alarm in every feature, exclaimed, "I am a lost man! They have
caught me!" Dalaber, who thought his friend was with his
brother at Stalbridge, could not conceal his astonishment, and
at the same time he cast an uneasy glance on a stranger who
accompanied Garret. He was one of the college servants who
had led the fugitive curate to Dalaber's new room. As soon as
this man had gone away, Garret told Anthony everything:
"Observing that Dr. Cottisford and his household had gone to
prayers, I put back the bolt of the lock with my finger ...
and here I am."... "Alas! Master Garret," replied Dalaber,
"the imprudence you committed in speaking to me before
that young man has ruined us both!" At these words, Garret,
who had resumed his fear of the priests, now that his conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
was satisfied, exclaimed with a voice interrupted by sighs and
tears:<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> "For mercy's sake, help me! Save me!" Without
waiting for an answer, he threw off his frock and hood, begged
Anthony to give him a sleeved coat, and thus disguised, he said:
"I will escape into Wales, and from there, if possible, to Germany
and Luther."</p>

<p>Garret checked himself; there was something to be done before
he left. The two friends fell on their knees and prayed together;
they called upon God to lead his servant to a secure retreat.
That done, they embraced each other, their faces bathed
with tears, and unable to utter a word.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Silent on the threshold of his door, Dalaber followed both
with eyes and ears his friend's retreating footsteps. Having
heard him reach the bottom of the stairs, he returned to his
room, locked the door, took out his New Testament, and placing
it before him, read on his knees the tenth chapter of the Gospel
of St. Matthew, breathing many a heavy sigh: .... <i>Ye shall be
brought before governors and kings for my sake ... but fear
them not; the very hairs of your head are all numbered</i>. This
reading having revived his courage, Anthony, still on his knees,
prayed fervently for the fugitive and for all his brethren: "O
God, by thy Holy Spirit endue with heavenly strength this tender
and new-born little flock in Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Christ's heavy cross
is about to be laid on the weak shoulders of thy poor sheep.
Grant that they may bear it with godly patience and unflinching
zeal!"</p>

<p>Rising from his knees, Dalaber put away his book, folded
up Garret's hood and frock, placed them among his own
clothes, locked his room door, and proceeded to the Cardinal's
College, (now Christ Church,) to tell Clark and the other
brethren what had happened.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> They were in chapel: the
evening service had begun; the dean and canons, in full costume,
were chanting in the choir. Dalaber stopped at the
door listening to the majestic sounds of the organ at which
Taverner presided, and to the harmonious strains of the
choristers. They were singing the <i>Magnificat: My soul
doth magnify the Lord.... He hath holpen his servant Israel</i>.
It seemed to Dalaber that they were singing Garret's deliverance.
But his voice could not join in their song of praise.
"Alas!" he exclaimed, "all my singing and music is turned
into sighing and musing."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">RAGE OF THE THREE DOCTORS.</div>

<p>As he listened, leaning against the entrance into the choir,
Dr. Cottisford, the university commissary, arrived with hasty
step, "bare headed, and as pale as ashes." He passed Anthony
without noticing him, and going straight to the dean appeared
to announce some important and unpleasant news. "I know
well the cause of his sorrow," thought Dalaber as he watched
every gesture. The commissary had scarcely finished his report
when the dean arose, and both left the choir with undisguised
confusion. They had only reached the middle of the anti-chapel
when Dr. London ran in, puffing and chafing and stamping, "like
a hungry and greedy lion seeking his prey."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> All three stopped,
questioned each other, and deplored their misfortune. Their
rapid and eager movements indicated the liveliest emotion; London
above all could not restrain himself. He attacked the commissary,
and blamed him for his negligence, so that at last Cottisford
burst into tears. "Deeds, not tears," said the fanatical
London; and forthwith they despatched officers and spies along
every road.</p>

<p>Anthony having left the chapel hurried to Clark's to tell him
of the escape of his friend. "We are walking in the midst of
wolves and tigers," replied Clark; "prepare for persecution.
<i>Prudentia serpentina et simplicitas columbina</i> (the wisdom of
serpents and the harmlessness of doves) must be our motto. O
God, give us the courage these evil times require." All in the
little flock were delighted at Garret's deliverance. Sumner and
Betts, who had come in, ran off to tell it to the other brethren
in the College,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> and Dalaber hastened to Corpus Christi. All
these pious young men felt themselves to be soldiers in the same
army, travellers in the same company, brothers in the same
family. Fraternal love nowhere shone so brightly in the days of
the Reformation as among the Christians of Great Britain.
This is a feature worthy of notice.</p>

<p>Fitzjames, Udal, and Diet were met together in the rooms of
the latter, at Corpus Christi college, when Dalaber arrived. They
ate their frugal meal, with downcast eyes and broken voices,
conversing of Oxford, of England, and of the perils hanging over
them.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Then rising from table they fell on their knees, called
upon God for aid, and separated, Fitzjames taking Dalaber with
him to St. Alban's Hall. They were afraid that the servant of
Gloucester College had betrayed him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DALABER'S ALARM.</div>

<p>The disciples of the gospel at Oxford passed the night in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
anxiety. Garret's flight, the rage of the priests, the dangers of
the rising church, the roaring of a storm that filled the air and
re-echoed through the long cloisters&mdash;all impressed them with
terror. On Sunday the 11th of February, Dalaber, who was
stirring at five in the morning, set out for his room in Gloucester
College. Finding the gates shut, he walked up and down
beneath the walls in the mud, for it had rained all night. As
he paced to and fro along the solitary street in the obscure
dawn, a thousand thoughts alarmed his mind. It was known,
he said to himself, that he had taken part in Garret's flight; he
would be arrested, and his friend's escape would be revenged on
him.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> He was weighed down by sorrow and alarm; he sighed
heavily;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> he imagined he saw Wolsey's commissioners demanding
the names of his accomplices, and pretending to draw up a proscription
list at his dictation; he recollected that on more than
one occasion cruel priests had extorted from the Lollards the
names of their brethren, and terrified at the possibility of such
a crime, he exclaimed; "O God, I swear to thee that I will
accuse no man, ... I will tell nothing but what is perfectly
well known."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>At last, after an hour of anguish, he was able to enter the
college. He hastened in, but when he tried to open his door,
he found that the lock had been picked. The door gave way
to a strong push, and what a sight met his eyes! his bedstead
overturned, the blankets scattered on the floor, his clothes all
confusion in his wardrobe, his study broken into and left open.
He doubted not that Garret's dress had betrayed him; and he was
gazing at this sad spectacle in alarm, when a monk who occupied
the adjoining rooms came and told him what had taken place:
"The commissary and two proctors, armed with swords and
bills, broke open your door in the middle of the night. They
pierced your bed-straw through and through to make sure
Garret was not hidden there;<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> they carefully searched every
nook and corner, but were not able to discover any traces of
the fugitive." At these words Dalaber breathed again ...
but the monk had not ended. "I have orders," he added, "to
send you to the prior." Anthony Dunstan, the prior, was a
fanatical and avaricious monk; and the confusion into which this
message threw Dalaber was so great, that he went just as he
was, all bespattered with mud, to the rooms of his superior.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">DALABER INTERROGATED.</div>

<p>The prior, who was standing with his face towards the door,
looked at Dalaber from head to foot as he came in. "Where
did you pass the night?" he asked. "At St. Alban's Hall with
Fitzjames." The prior with a gesture of incredulity continued:
"Was not Master Garret with you yesterday?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"Where
is he now?"&mdash;"I do not know." During this examination,
the prior had remarked a large double gilt silver ring on
Anthony's finger, with the initials A. D.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> "Show me that,"
said the prior. Dalaber gave him the ring, and the prior believing
it to be of solid gold, put it on his own finger, adding
with a cunning leer: "This ring is mine: it bears my name. A
is for <i>Anthony</i>, and D for <i>Dunstan</i>." "Would to God," thought
Dalaber, "that I were as well delivered from his company, as I
am sure of being delivered of my ring."</p>

<p>At this moment the chief beadle, with two or three of the
commissary's men, entered and conducted Dalaber to the chapel
of Lincoln college, where three ill-omened figures were standing
beside the altar: they were Cottisford, London, and Higdon.
"Where is Garret?" asked London; and pointing to his disordered
dress, he continued: "Your shoes and garments covered with
mud prove that you have been out all night with him. If you
do not say where you have taken him, you will be sent to the
Tower."&mdash;"Yes," added Higdon, "to <i>Little-ease</i> [one of the
most horrible dungeons in the prison,] and you will be put to
the torture, do you hear?" Then the three doctors spent two
hours attempting to shake the young man by flattering promises
and frightful threats; but all was useless. The commissary then
gave a sign, the officers stepped forward, and the judges ascended
a narrow staircase leading to a large room situated above the
commissary's chamber. Here Dalaber was deprived of his purse
and girdle, and his legs were placed in the stocks, so that his
feet were almost as high as his head.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> When that was done,
the three doctors devoutly went to mass.</p>

<p>Poor Anthony, left alone in this frightful position, recollected
the warning Clark had given him two years before. He groaned
heavily and cried to God:<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> "O Father! that my suffering may
be for thy glory, and for the consolation of my brethren!
Happen what may, I will never accuse one of them." After
this noble protest, Anthony felt an increase of peace in his heart;
but a new sorrow was reserved for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GARRET AND OTHERS IMPRISONED.</div>

<p>Garret, who had directed his course westwards, with the intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of going to Wales, had been caught at Hinksey, a short
distance from Oxford. He was brought back, and thrown into
the dungeon in which Dalaber had been placed after the torture.
Their gloomy presentiments were to be more than fulfilled.</p>

<p>In fact Wolsey was deeply irritated at seeing the college
[Christ Church], which he had intended should be "the most
glorious in the world," made the haunt of heresy, and the young
men, whom he had so carefully chosen, become distributors of
the New Testament. By favouring literature, he had had in
view the triumph of the clergy, and literature had on the contrary
served to the triumph of the Gospel. He issued his orders
without delay, and the university was filled with terror. John
Clark, John Fryth, Henry Sumner, William Betts, Richard
Taverner, Richard Cox, Michael Drumm, Godfrey Harman,
Thomas Lawney, Radley, and others besides of Cardinal's College;
Udal, Diet, and others of Corpus Christi; Eden and several of
his friends of Magdalene; Goodman, William Bayley, Robert
Ferrar, John Salisbury of Gloucester, Barnard, and St. Mary's
Colleges; were seized and thrown into prison. Wolsey had promised
them glory; he gave them a dungeon, hoping in this
manner to save the power of the priests, and to repress that
awakening of truth and liberty which was spreading from the
continent to England.</p>

<p>Under Cardinal's College there was a deep cellar sunk in the
earth, in which the butler kept his salt fish. Into this hole
these young men, the choice of England, were thrust. The
dampness of this cave, the corrupted air they breathed, the
horrible smell given out by the fish, seriously affected the
prisoners, already weakened by study. Their hearts were bursting
with groans, their faith was shaken, and the most mournful
scenes followed each other in this foul dungeon. The wretched
captives gazed on one another, wept, and prayed. This trial
was destined to be a salutary one to them: "Alas!" said Fryth
on a subsequent occasion, "I see that besides the word of God,
there is indeed a second purgatory ... but it is not that
invented by Rome; it is the cross of tribulation to which God
has nailed us."<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDEMNATION AND HUMILIATION.</div>

<p>At last the prisoners were taken out one by one and brought
before their judges; two only were released. The first was
Betts, afterwards chaplain to Anne Boleyn: they had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
able to find any prohibited books in his room, and he pleaded
his cause with great talent. The other was Taverner; he had
hidden Clark's books under his school-room floor, where they
had been discovered; but his love for the arts saved him:
"Pshaw! he is only a musician," said the cardinal.</p>

<p>All the rest were condemned. A great fire was kindled at
the top of the market-place;<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> a long procession was marshalled,
and these unfortunate men were led out, each bearing a fagot.
When they came near the fire, they were compelled to throw
into it the heretical books that had been found in their rooms,
after which they were taken back to their noisome prison.
There seemed to be a barbarous pleasure in treating these young
and generous men so vilely. In other countries also, Rome
was preparing to stifle in the flames the noblest geniuses of
France, Spain, and Italy. Such was the reception letters and
the Gospel met with from popery in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Every plant of God's must be beaten by the wind, even at the
risk of its being uprooted; if it receives only the gentle rays of
the sun, there is reason to fear that it will dry up and wither
before it produces fruit. <i>Except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abideth alone.</i> There was to arise one day
a real church in England, for the persecution had begun.</p>

<p>We have to contemplate still further trials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPREMACY OF SELF IN ROMANISM.</div>

<p>Cambridge, which had produced Latimer, Bilney, Stafford,
and Barnes, had at first appeared to occupy the front rank in
the English reformation. Oxford by receiving the crown of
persecution seemed now to have outstripped the sister university.
And yet Cambridge was to have its share of suffering. The investigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
had begun at Oxford on Monday the 5th of February,
and on the very same day two of Wolsey's creatures, Dr. Capon,
one of his chaplains, and Gibson, a sergeant-at-arms, notorious
for his arrogance, left London for Cambridge. Submission,
was the pass-word of popery. "Yes, submission," was responded
from every part of Christendom by men of sincere piety and
profound understanding; "submission to the legitimate authority
against which Roman-catholicism has rebelled." According to
their views the traditionalism and pelagianism of the Romish
church had set up the supremacy of fallen reason in opposition
to the divine supremacy of the word and of grace. The external
and apparent sacrifice of self which Roman-catholicism imposes,&mdash;obedience
to a confessor or to the pope, arbitrary penance,
ascetic practices, and celibacy,&mdash;only served to create, and so
to strengthen and perpetuate, a delusion as to the egotistic preservation
of a sinful personality. When the Reformation proclaimed
liberty, so far as regarded ordinances of human invention,
it was with the view of bringing man's heart and life into subjection
to their real Sovereign. The reign of God was commencing;
that of the priests must needs come to an end. No
man can serve two masters. Such were the important truths
which gradually dawned upon the world, and which it became
necessary to extinguish without delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEARCH FOR THE HERETICAL BOOKS.</div>

<p>On the day after their arrival in Cambridge, on Tuesday the
6th of February, Capon and Gibson went to the convocation
house, where several of the doctors were talking together.
Their appearance caused some anxiety among the spectators,
who looked upon the strangers with distrust. On a sudden
Gibson moved forward, put his hand on Barnes, and arrested
him in the presence of his friends.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> The latter were frightened,
and this was what the sergeant wanted. "What!" said they,
"the prior of the Augustines, the restorer of letters in Cambridge,
arrested by a sergeant!" This was not all. Wolsey's agents
were to seize the books come from Germany, and their owners;
Bilney, Latimer, Stafford, Arthur, and their friends, were all to
be imprisoned, for they possessed the New Testament. Thirty
members of the university were pointed out as suspected; and
some miserable wretches, who had been bribed by the inquisitors,
offered to show the place in every room where the prohibited
books were hidden. But while the necessary preparations were
making for this search, Bilney, Latimer, and their colleagues,
being warned in time, got the books removed; they were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
away not only by the doors but by the windows, even by the
roofs, and anxious inquiry was made for sure places in which
they could be concealed.</p>

<p>This work was hardly ended, when the vice-chancellor of the
university, the sergeant-at-arms, Wolsey's chaplain, the proctors,
and the informers began their rounds. They opened the first
room, entered, searched, and found nothing. They passed
on to the second, there was nothing. The sergeant was astonished,
and grew angry. On reaching the third room, he ran
directly to the place that had been pointed out,&mdash;still there
was nothing. The same thing occurred every where; never was
inquisitor more mortified. He dared not lay hands on the persons
of the evangelical doctors; his orders bore that he was to
seize the books and <i>their owners</i>. But as no books were found,
there could be no prisoners. Luckily there was one man (the
prior of the Augustines) against whom there were particular
charges. The sergeant promised to compensate himself at
Barnes's expense for his useless labours.</p>

<p>The next day Gibson and Capon set out for London with
Barnes. During this mournful journey the prior, in great agitation,
at one time determined to brave all England, and at
another trembled like a leaf. At last their journey was ended;
the chaplain left his prisoner at Parnell's house, close by the
stocks.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Three students (Coverdale, Goodwin, and Field) had
followed their master to cheer him with their tender affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION BETWEEN WOLSEY AND BARNES.</div>

<p>On Thursday (8th February) the sergeant conducted Barnes
to the cardinal's palace at Westminster; the wretched prior,
whose enthusiasm had given way to objection, waited all day
before he could be admitted. What a day! Will no one come
to his assistance? Doctor Gardiner, Wolsey's secretary, and
Fox, his steward, both old friends of Barnes, passed through the
gallery in the evening, and went up to the prisoner, who begged
them to procure him an audience with the cardinal. When
night had come, these officers introduced the prior into the
room where their master was sitting, and Barnes, as was customary,
fell on his knees before him. "Is this the Doctor
Barnes who is accused of heresy?" asked Wolsey, in a haughty
tone, of Fox and Gardiner. They replied in the affirmative.
The cardinal then turning to Barnes, who was still kneeling, said
to him ironically, and not without reason: "What, master doctor,
had you not sufficient scope in the Scriptures to teach the
people; but my golden shoes, my poleaxes, my pillars, my golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
cushions, my crosses, did so sore offend you, that you must make
us a laughing-stock, <i>ridiculum caput</i>, amongst the people? We
were jollily that day laughed to scorn. Verily it was a sermon
more fit to be preached on a stage than in a pulpit; for at the
last you said I wore a pair of <i>red</i> gloves&mdash;I should say <i>bloody</i>
gloves (quoth you)....Eh! what think you, master
doctor?" Barnes, wishing to elude these embarrassing questions,
answered vaguely: "I spoke nothing but the truth out of
the Scriptures, according to my conscience and according to the
old doctors." He then presented to the cardinal a statement of
his teaching.</p>

<p>Wolsey received the papers with a smile: "Oh, ho!" said he
as he counted the six sheets, "I perceive you intend to stand to
your articles and to show your learning." "With the grace of
God," said Barnes. Wolsey then began to read them, and
stopped at the sixth article, which ran thus: "I will never believe
that one man may, by the law of God, be bishop of two or
three cities, yea, of a whole country, for it is contrary to St.
Paul, who saith: <i>I have left thee behind, to set in every city
a bishop</i>." Barnes did not quote correctly, for the apostle
says: "<i>to ordain elders in every city</i>."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Wolsey was displeased
at this thesis: "Ah! this touches me," he said: "Do you
think it wrong (seeing the ordinance of the church) that one
bishop should have so many cities underneath him?" "I know
of no ordinance of the church," Barnes replied, "as concerning
this thing, but Paul's saying only."</p>

<p>Although this controversy interested the cardinal, the personal
attack of which he had to complain touched him more keenly.
"Good," said Wolsey; and then with a condescension hardly to
be expected from so proud a man, he deigned almost to justify
himself. "You charge me with displaying a royal pomp; but
do you not understand that, being called to represent his majesty,
I must strive by these means to strike terror into the
wicked?"&mdash;"It is not your pomp or your poleaxes," Barnes
courageously answered, "that will save the king's person....
God will save him, who said: <i>Per me reges regnant</i>." Barnes,
instead of profiting by the cardinal's kindness to present an
humble justification, as Dean Colet had formerly done to Henry
VIII, dared preach him a second sermon to his face. Wolsey
felt the colour mount to his cheeks. "Well, gentlemen," said
he, turning to Fox and Gardiner, "you hear him! Is this the
wise and learned man of whom you spoke to me?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARNES FALLS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>At these words both steward and secretary fell on their
knees, saying: "My lord, pardon him for mercy's sake."&mdash;"Can
you find ten or even six doctors of divinity willing to swear that
you are free from heresy?" asked Wolsey. Barnes offered
twenty honest men, quite as learned as himself, or even more
so. "I must have doctors in divinity, men as old as yourself."&mdash;"That
is impossible," said the prior. "In that
case you must be burnt," continued the cardinal. "Let him
be taken to the Tower." Gardiner and Fox offering to become
his sureties, Wolsey permitted him to pass the night at Parnell's.</p>

<p>"It is no time to think of sleeping," said Barnes as he entered
the house, "we must write." Those harsh and terrible words,
<i>you must be burnt</i>, resounded continually in his ears. He dictated
all night to his three young friends a defence of his
articles.</p>

<p>The next day he was taken before the chapter, at which
Clarke, bishop of Bath, Standish, and other doctors were present.
His judges laid before him a long statement, and said to
him: "Promise to read this paper in public, without omitting
or adding a single word." It was then read to him. "I would
die first," was his reply. "Will you abjure or be burnt alive?"
said his judges; "take your choice." The alternative was
dreadful. Poor Barnes, a prey to the deepest agony, shrank at
the thought of the stake; then, suddenly his courage revived,
and he exclaimed: "I had rather be burnt than abjure."
Gardiner and Fox did all they could to persuade him.
"Listen to reason," said they craftily: "your articles are true;
that is not the question. We want to know whether by
your death you will let error triumph, or whether you would
rather remain to defend the truth, when better days may
come."</p>

<p>They entreated him; they put forward the most plausible
motives; from time to time they uttered the terrible words,
<i>burnt alive!</i> His blood froze in his veins; he knew not what he
said or did ... they placed a paper before him&mdash;they put
a pen in his hand&mdash;his head was bewildered, he signed his name
with a deep sigh. This unhappy man was destined at a later
period to be a faithful martyr of Jesus Christ; but he had
not yet learnt to "resist even unto blood." Barnes had fallen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS PUBLIC PENANCE.</div>

<p>On the following morning (Sunday, 11th February) a solemn
spectacle was preparing at St. Paul's. Before daybreak, all
were astir in the prison of the poor prior; and at eight o'clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the knight-marshal with his tipstaves, and the warden of the
Fleet prison, with his billmen, conducted Barnes to St. Paul's,
along with four of the Hanse merchants who had first brought
to London the New Testament of Jesus Christ in English. The
fifth of these pious merchants held an immense taper in his
hands. A persevering search had discovered that it was these
men to whom England was indebted for the so much dreaded
book; their warehouses were surrounded and their persons arrested.
On the top of St. Paul's steps was a platform, and on
the platform a throne, and on the throne the cardinal, dressed
in scarlet&mdash;like a "bloody antichrist," says the chronicler. On
his head glittered the hat of which Barnes had spoken so ill;
around him were thirty-six bishops, abbots, priors, and all his
doctors, dressed in damask and satin; the vast cathedral was
full. The bishop of Rochester having gone into a pulpit placed
at the top of the steps, Barnes and the merchants, each bearing
a faggot, were compelled to kneel and listen to a sermon intended
to cure these poor creatures of that taste for insurrection against
popery which was beginning to spread in every quarter. The
sermon ended, the cardinal mounted his mule, took his station
under a magnificent canopy, and rode off. After this Barnes
and his five companions walked three times round a fire, lighted
before the cross at the north gate of the cathedral. The dejected
prior, with downcast head, dragged himself along, rather
than walked. After the third turn, the prisoners threw their
faggots into the flames; some "heretical" books also were flung
in; and the bishop of Rochester having given absolution to the
six penitents, they were led back to prison to be kept there
during the lord cardinal's pleasure. Barnes could not weep now;
the thought of his relapse, and of the effects so guilty an example
might produce, had deprived him of all moral energy.
In the month of August, he was led out of prison and confined
in the Augustine convent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONK OF BURY.</div>

<p>Barnes was not the only man at Cambridge upon whom the
blow had fallen. Since the year 1520, a monk named Richard
Bayfield had been an inmate of the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds.
His affability delighted every traveller. One day, when engaged
as chamberlain in receiving Barnes, who had come to visit Doctor
Ruffam, his fellow-student at Louvain, two men entered the
convent. They were pious persons, and of great consideration
in London, where they carried on the occupation of brick-making,
and had risen to be wardens of their guild. Their names
were Maxwell and Stacy, men "well grafted in the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Christ," says the historian, who had led many to the Saviour by
their conversation and exemplary life. Being accustomed to
travel once a-year through the counties to visit their brethren,
and extend a knowledge of the Gospel, they used to lodge, according
to the usages of the time, in the convents and abbeys.
A conversation soon arose between Barnes, Stacy, and Maxwell,
which struck the lay-brother. Barnes, who had observed his
attention, gave him, as he was leaving the convent, a New Testament
in Latin, and the two brick-makers added a New Testament
in English, with <i>The Wicked Mammon</i> and <i>The Obedience
of a Christian Man</i>. The lay-brother ran and hid the books in
his cell, and for two years read them constantly. At last he
was discovered, and reprimanded; but he boldly confessed his
faith. Upon this the monks threw him into prison, set him in
the stocks, put a gag in his mouth, and cruelly whipped him, to
prevent his speaking of grace.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> The unhappy Bayfield remained
nine months in this condition.</p>

<p>When Barnes repeated his visit to Bury at a later period, he
did not find the amiable chamberlain at the gates of the abbey.
Upon inquiry he learnt his condition, and immediately took
steps to procure his deliverance. Dr. Ruffam came to his aid:
"Give him to me," said Barnes, "I will take him to Cambridge."
The prior of the Augustines was at that time held in high
esteem; his request was granted, in the hope that he would lead
back Bayfield to the doctrines of the church. But the very
reverse took place: intercourse with the Cambridge brethren
strengthened the young monk's faith. On a sudden his happiness
vanished. Barnes, his friend and benefactor, was carried
to London, and the monks of Bury St. Edmunds, alarmed at
the noise this affair created, summoned him to return to the
abbey. But Bayfield, resolving to submit to their yoke no
longer, went to London, and lay concealed at Maxwell and
Stacy's. One day, having left his hiding-place, he was crossing
Lombard Street, when he met a priest named Pierson and two
other religious of his order, with whom he entered into a conversation
which greatly scandalized them. "You must depart
forthwith," said Maxwell and Stacy to him on his return. Bayfield
received a small sum of money from them, went on board
a ship, and as soon as he reached the continent, hastened to
find Tyndale. During this time scenes of a very different nature
from those which had taken place at Cambridge, but not less
heart-rending, were passing at Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSORS IN THE CELLAR AT OXFORD.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>The storm of persecution was raging there with more violence
than at Cambridge. Clark and the other confessors of the name
of Christ were still confined in their under-ground prison. The
air they breathed, the food they took (and they ate nothing but
salt fish<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>), the burning thirst this created, the thoughts by
which they were agitated, all together combined to crush these
noble-hearted men. Their bodies wasted day by day; they wandered
like spectres up and down their gloomy cellar. Those
animated discussions in which the deep questions then convulsing
Christendom were so eloquently debated were at an end;
they were like shadow meeting shadow. Their hollow eyes cast
a vague and haggard glance on one another, and after gazing
for a moment, they passed on without speaking. Clark, Sumner,
Bayley, and Goodman, consumed by fever, feebly crawled along,
leaning against their dungeon walls. The first, who was also
the eldest, could not walk without the support of one of his
fellow-prisoners. Soon he was quite unable to move, and lay
stretched upon the damp floor. The brethren gathered round
him, sought to discover in his features whether death was not
about to cut short the days of him who had brought many of
them to the knowledge of Christ. They repeated to him slowly
the words of Scripture, and then knelt down by his side and
uttered a fervent prayer.</p>

<p>Clark, feeling his end draw near, asked for the communion.
The jailors conveyed his request to their master; the noise of
the bolts was soon heard, and a turnkey, stepping into the midst
of the disconsolate band, pronounced a cruel <i>no!</i><a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> On hearing
this, Clark looked towards heaven, and exclaimed with a father
of the church: <i>Crede et manducasti</i>, Believe and thou hast eaten.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
He was lost in thought: he contemplated the crucified Son of
God; by faith he ate and drank the flesh and blood of Christ,
and experienced in his inner life the strengthening action of the
Redeemer. Men might refuse him the host, but Jesus had
given him his body; and from that hour he felt strengthened by
a living union with the King of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF FOUR PRISONERS.</div>

<p>Not alone did Clark descend into the shadowy valley: Sumner,
Bayley, and Goodman were sinking rapidly. Death, the gloomy
inhabitant of this foul prison, had taken possession of these four
friends.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Their brethren addressed fresh solicitations to the
cardinal, at that time closely occupied in negotiations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
France, Rome, and Venice.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> He found means, however, to give
a moment to the Oxford martyrs; and just as these Christians
were praying over their four dying companions, the commissioner
came and informed them, that "his lordship, of his
great goodness, permitted the sick persons to be removed to
their own chambers." Litters were brought, on which the
dying men were placed and carried to their rooms;<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> the doors
were closed again upon those whose lives this frightful dungeon
had not yet attacked.</p>

<p>It was the middle of August. The wretched men who had
passed six months in the cellar were transported in vain to their
chambers and their beds; several members of the university
ineffectually tried by their cares and their tender charity to recall
them to life. It was too late. The severities of popery
had killed these noble witnesses. The approach of death soon
betrayed itself; their blood grew cold, their limbs stiff, and their
bedimmed eyes sought only Jesus Christ, their everlasting hope.
Clark, Sumner, and Bayley died in the same week. Goodman
followed close upon them.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>This unexpected catastrophe softened Wolsey. He was cruel
only as far as his interest and the safety of the church required.
He feared that the death of so many young men would raise
public opinion against him, or that these catastrophes would
damage his college; perhaps even some sentiment of humanity
may have touched his heart. "Set the rest at liberty," he
wrote to his agents, "but upon condition that they do not go
above ten miles from Oxford." The university beheld these
young men issue from their living tomb pale, wasted, weak, and
with faltering steps. At that time they were not men of mark;
it was their youth that touched the spectators' hearts; but in
after-years they all occupied an important place in the church.
They were Cox, who became Bishop of Ely, and tutor to
Edward the Prince Royal; Drumm, who under Cranmer became
one of the six preachers at Canterbury; Udal, afterwards master
of Westminster and Eton schools; Salisbury, dean of Norwich,
and then bishop of Sodor and Man, who in all his wealth and
greatness often recalled his frightful prison at Oxford as a title
to glory; Ferrar, afterwards Cranmer's chaplain, bishop of St.
David's, and a martyr even unto death, after an interval of
thirty years; Fryth, Tyndale's friend, to whom this deliverance

forth from their terrible dungeon, their friends ran up to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
supported their faltering steps, and embraced them amidst

and went to Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Thus was the tempest stayed which
had so fearfully ravaged Oxford. But the calm was of no long
duration; an unexpected circumstance became perilous to the
cause of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S LETTER TO THE KING.</div>

<p>Henry was still under the impression of the famous <i>Supplication
of the Beggars</i>, when Luther's interference increased his
anger. The letter which, at the advice of Christiern, king of
Denmark, this reformer had written to him in September 1525,
had miscarried. The Wittemberg doctor hearing nothing of it,
had boldly printed it, and sent a copy to the king. "I am informed,"
said Luther, "that your Majesty is beginning to favour
the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> and to be disgusted with the perverse race that
fights against it in your noble kingdom.... It is true that,
according to Scripture, <i>the kings of the earth take counsel together
against the Lord</i>, and we cannot, consequently, expect to see
them favourable to the truth. How fervently do I wish that
this miracle may be accomplished in the person of your Majesty."<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S REPLY.</div>

<p>We may imagine Henry's wrath as he read this letter.
"What!" said he, "does this apostate monk dare print a letter
addressed to us, without having even sent it, or at the least
without knowing if we have ever received it?... And
as if that were not enough, he insinuates that we are among
his partisans.... He wins over also one or two wretches,
born in our kingdom, and engages them to translate
the New Testament into English, adding thereto certain prefaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and poisonous glosses." Thus spoke Henry. The idea
that his name should be associated with that of the Wittemberg
monk called all the blood into his face. He will reply right
royally to such unblushing impudence. He summoned Wolsey
forthwith. "Here!" said he, pointing to a passage concerning
the prelate, "here! read what is said of you!" And then he
read aloud: "<i>Illud monstrum et publicum odium Dei et hominum,
cardinalis Eboracensis, pestis illa regni tui</i>. You see, my lord,
you are a <i>monster</i>, an object of <i>hatred</i> both to God and man,
the <i>scourge</i> of my kingdom!" The king had hitherto allowed
the bishops to do as they pleased, and observed a sort of neutrality.
He now determined to lay it aside and begin a
crusade against the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but he must first
answer this impertinent letter. He consulted Sir Thomas More,
shut himself in his closet, and dictated to his secretary a reply
to the reformer: "You are ashamed of the book you have
written against me," he said, "I would counsel you to be
ashamed of all that you have written. They are full of disgusting
errors and frantic heresies; and are supported by the
most audacious obstinacy. Your venemous pen mocks the
church, insults the fathers, abuses the saints, despises the apostles,
dishonours the holy virgin, and blasphemes God, by making
him the author of evil.... And after all that, you claim to
be an author whose like does not exist in the world!"<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>"You offer to publish a book in my praise.... I thank
you!... You will praise me most by abusing me; you will
dishonour me beyond measure if you praise me. I say with
Seneca: <i>Tam turpe tibi sit laudari a turpibus, quam si lauderis
ob turpia</i>."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>This letter, written by the <i>king of the English to the king of
the heretics</i>,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> was immediately circulated throughout England
bound up with Luther's epistle. Henry, by publishing it, put
his subjects on their guard against the <i>unfaithful</i> translations
of the New Testament, which were besides about to be burnt
everywhere. "The grapes seem beautiful," he said, "but beware
how you wet your lips with the wine made from them, for
the adversary hath mingled poison with it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S FIRMNESS.</div>

<p>Luther, agitated by this rude lesson, tried to excuse himself.
"I said to myself, <i>There are twelve hours in the day</i>. Who
knows? perhaps I may find one lucky hour to gain the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
England. I therefore laid my humble epistle at his feet; but
alas! the swine have torn it. I am willing to be silent ...
but as regards my doctrine, I cannot impose silence on it. It
must cry aloud, it must bite. If any king imagines he can make
me retract my faith, he is a dreamer. So long as one drop of
blood remains in my body, I shall say no. Emperors, kings,
the devil, and even the whole universe, cannot frighten me
when faith is concerned. I claim to be proud, very proud,
exceedingly proud. If my doctrine had no other enemies than
the king of England, Duke George, the pope and their allies,
all these soap-bubbles ... one little prayer would long ago
have worsted them all. Where are Pilate, Herod, and Caiaphas
now? Where are Nero, Domitian, and Maximilian? Where are
Arius, Pelagius, and Manes?&mdash;Where are they?... Where
all our scribes and all our tyrants will soon be.&mdash;But Christ?
Christ is the same always.</p>

<p>"For a thousand years the Holy Scriptures have not shone
in the world with so much brightness as now.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> I wait in peace
for my last hour; I have done what I could. O princes, my
hands are clean from your blood; it will fall on your own
heads."</p>

<p>Bowing before the supreme royalty of Jesus Christ, Luther
spoke thus boldly to King Henry, who contested the rights of
the word of God.</p>

<p>A letter written against the reformer was not enough for the
bishops. Profiting by the wound Luther had inflicted on Henry's
self-esteem, they urged him to put down this revolt of the
human understanding, which threatened (as they averred) both
the popedom and the monarchy. They commenced the persecution.
Latimer was summoned before Wolsey, but his learning
and presence of mind procured his dismissal. Bilney also, who
had been ordered to London, received an injunction not to preach
<i>Luther's doctrines</i>. "I will not preach Luther's doctrines, if
there are any peculiar to him," he said; "but I can and I must
preach the doctrine of Jesus Christ, although Luther should
preach it too." And finally Garret, led into the presence of his
judges, was seized with terror, and fell before the cruel threats
of the bishop. When restored to liberty, he fled from place to
place,<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> endeavouring to hide his sorrow, and to escape from the
despotism of the priests, awaiting the moment when he should
give his life for Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARNES ESCAPES.</div>

<p>The adversaries of the Reformation were not yet satisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
The New Testament continued to circulate, and depots were
formed in several convents. Barnes, a prisoner in the Augustine
monastery in London, had regained his courage, and loved his
Bible more and more. One day about the end of September,
as three or four friends were reading in his chamber, two simple
peasants, John Tyball and Thomas Hilles, natives of Bumpstead
in Essex, came in. "How did you come to a knowledge of the
truth?" asked Barnes. They drew from their pockets some old
volumes containing the Gospels, and a few of the Epistles in
English. Barnes returned them with a smile. "They are
nothing," he told them, "in comparison with the new edition
of the New Testament,"<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> a copy of which the two peasants
bought for three shillings and two-pence. "Hide it carefully,"
said Barnes. When this came to the ears of the clergy, Barnes
was removed to Northampton to be burnt at the stake; but he
managed to escape; his friends reported that he was drowned;
and while strict search was making for him during a whole
week along the sea-coast, he secretly went on board a ship, and
was carried to Germany. "The cardinal will catch him even
now," said the bishop of London, "whatever amount of money
it may cost him." When Barnes was told of this, he remarked:
"I am a poor simple wretch, not worth the tenth penny they
will give for me. Besides, if they burn me, what will they gain
by it?... The sun and the moon, fire and water, the stars
and the elements&mdash;yea, and also stones shall defend this cause
against them, <i>rather than the truth should perish</i>." Faith had
returned to Barnes's feeble heart.</p>

<p>His escape added fuel to the wrath of the clergy. They proclaimed,
throughout the length and breadth of England, that
the Holy Scriptures contained an <i>infectious poison</i>,<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> and ordered
a general search after the word of God. On the 24th of October,
1526, the bishop of London enjoined on his archdeacons
to seize all translations of the New Testament in English with
or without glosses; and, a few days later, the archbishop of
Canterbury issued a mandate against all the books which should
contain "any particle of the New Testament."<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> The primate
remembered that a spark was sufficient to kindle a large
fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROY'S SATIRE.</div>

<p>On hearing of this order, William Roy, a sarcastic writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
published a violent satire, in which figured <i>Judas</i> (Standish),
<i>Pilate</i> (Wolsey), and <i>Caiaphas</i> (Tonstall). The author exclaimed
with energy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">God, of his goodness, grudged not to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Man to deliver from deadly damnation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose will is, that we should know perfectly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What he here hath done for our salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O cruel Caiaphas! full of crafty conspiration,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How durst thou give them false judgment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn God's word&mdash;the Holy Testament.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a><br /></span>
</div>

<p>The efforts of Caiaphas and his colleagues were indeed useless:
the priests were undertaking a work beyond their strength. If
by some terrible revolution all social forms should be destroyed
in the world, the living church of the elect, a divine institution
in the midst of human institutions, would still exist by the
power of God, like a rock in the midst of the tempest, and
would transmit to future generations the seeds of Christian life
and civilization. It is the same with the word, the creative
principle of the church. It cannot perish here below. The
priests of England had something to learn on this matter.</p>

<p>While the agents of the clergy were carrying out the archiepiscopal
mandate, and a merciless search was making everywhere
for the New Testaments from Worms, a new edition was discovered,
fresh from the press, of a smaller and more portable,
and consequently more dangerous size. It was printed by
Christopher Eyndhoven of Antwerp, who had consigned it to
his correspondents in London. The annoyance of the priests
was extreme, and Hackett, the agent of Henry VIII in the Low
Countries, immediately received orders to get this man punished.
"We cannot deliver judgment without inquiry into the matter,"
said the lords of Antwerp; "we will therefore have the book
translated into Flemish." "God forbid," said Hackett in alarm,
"What! would you also on your side of the ocean translate this
book into the language of the people?" "Well then," said one
of the judges, less conscientious than his colleagues, "let the king
of England send us a copy of each of the books he has burnt,
and we will burn them likewise." Hackett wrote to Wolsey for
them, and as soon as they arrived the court met again. Eyndhoven's
counsel called upon the prosecutor to point out the
<i>heresies</i> contained in the volume. The margrave (an officer of
the imperial government) shrank from the task, and said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Hackett, "I give up the business!" The charge against Eyndhoven
was dismissed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAW AND LIBERTY.</div>

<p>Thus did the Reformation awaken in Europe the slumbering
spirit of law and liberty. By enfranchising thought from the
yoke of popery, it prepared the way for other enfranchisements;
and by restoring the authority of the word of God, it brought
back the reign of the law among nations long the prey of turbulent
passions and arbitrary power. Then, as at all times, religious
society forestalled civil society, and gave it those two great
principles of order and liberty, which popery compromises or
annuls. It was not in vain that the magistrates of a Flemish
city, enlightened by the first dawn of the Reformation, set so
noble an example; the English, who were very numerous in the
Hanse Towns, thus learnt once more the value of that civil and
religious liberty which is the time-honoured right of England,
and of which they were in after-years to give other nations the
so much needed lessons.</p>

<p>"Well then," said Hackett, who was annoyed at their setting
the law above his master's will, "I will go and buy all these
books, and send them to the cardinal, that he may burn them."
With these words he left the court. But his anger evaporating,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
he set off for Malines to complain to the regent and
her council of the Antwerp decision. "What!" said he, "you
punish those who circulate false money, and you will not punish
still more severely the man who coins it?&mdash;in this case, he is
the printer." "But that is just the point in dispute," they
replied; "we are not sure the money is <i>false</i>."&mdash;"How can it be
otherwise," answered Henry's agent, "since the bishops of England
have declared it so?" The imperial government, which
was not very favourably disposed towards England, ratified
Eyndhoven's acquittal, but permitted Hackett to burn all the
copies of the New Testament he could seize. He hastened to
profit by this concession, and began hunting after the Holy
Scriptures, while the priests eagerly came to his assistance. In
their view, as well as in that of their English colleagues, the
supreme decision in matter of faith rested not with the word of
God but with the pope; and the best means of securing this
privilege to the pontiff was to reduce the Bible to ashes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these trials, the year 1526 was a memorable
one for England. The English New Testament had been circulated
from the shores of the Channel to the borders of Scotland,
and the Reformation had begun in that island by the word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
God. The revival of the sixteenth century was in no country
less than in England the emanation of a royal mandate. But
God, who had disseminated the Scriptures over Britain, in defiance
of the rulers of the nation, was about to make use of their
passions to remove the difficulties which opposed the final triumph
of his plans. We here enter upon a new phasis in the
history of the Reformation; and having studied the work of
God in the faith of the little ones, we proceed to contemplate
the work of man in the intrigues of the great ones of the
earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY DESIRES TO BE REVENGED.</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DIVORCE SUGGESTED.</div>

<p>Wolsey, mortified at not being able to obtain the pontifical
throne, to which he had so ardently aspired, and being especially
irritated by the ill-will of Charles V, meditated a plan which,
entirely unsuspected by him, was to lead to the enfranchisement
of England from the papal yoke. "They laugh at me,
and thrust me into the second rank," he had exclaimed. "So
be it! I will create such a confusion in the world as has not
been seen for ages.... I will do it, even should England
be swallowed up in the tempest!"<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Desirous of exciting imperishable
hatred between Henry VIII and Charles V, he had
undertaken to break the marriage which Henry VII and Ferdinand
the Catholic had planned to unite for ever their families
and their crowns. His hatred of Charles was not his only motive.
Catherine had reproached him for his dissolute life,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
and he had sworn to be revenged. There can be no doubt
about Wolsey's share in the matter. "The <i>first terms</i> of the
divorce were put forward by me," he told the French ambassador.
"I did it," he added, "to cause a lasting separation
between the houses of England and Burgundy."<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
informed writers of the sixteenth century, men of the most
opposite parties, Pole, Polydore, Virgil, Tyndale, Meteren, Pallavicini,
Sanders, and Roper, More's son-in-law, all agree in pointing
to Wolsey as the instigator of that divorce, which has become
so famous.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> He desired to go still farther, and after
inducing the king to put away his queen, he hoped to prevail
on the pope to depose the emperor.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> It was not his passion for
Anne Boleyn, as so many of the Romish fabulists have repeated;
but the passion of a cardinal for the triple crown which gave
the signal of England's emancipation. Offended pride is one of
the most active principles of human nature.</p>

<p>Wolsey's design was a strange one, and difficult of execution,
but not impossible. Henry was living apparently on the best
terms with Catherine; on more than one occasion Erasmus had
spoken of the royal family of England as the pattern of the
domestic virtues. But the most ardent of Henry's desires was
not satisfied; he had no son; those whom the queen had borne
him had died in their infancy, and Mary alone survived. The
deaths of these little children, at all times so heart-rending, were
particularly so in the palace of Greenwich. It appeared to
Catherine that the shade of the last Plantagenet, immolated on
her marriage altar, came forth to seize one after another the
heirs she gave to the throne of England, and to carry them
away to his tomb. The queen shed tears almost unceasingly,
and implored the divine mercy, while the king cursed his unhappy
fate. The people seemed to share in the royal sorrow;
and men of learning and piety (Longland was among their number)<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
declared against the validity of the marriage. They said
that "the papal dispensations had no force when in opposition
to the law of God." Yet hitherto Henry had rejected every
idea of a divorce.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>The times had changed since 1509. The king had loved
Catherine: her reserve, mildness, and dignity, had charmed him.
Greedy of pleasure and applause, he was delighted to see his
wife content to be the quiet witness of his joys and of his triumphs.
But gradually the queen had grown older, her Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
gravity had increased, her devout practices were multiplied, and
her infirmities, become more frequent, had left the king no hope
of having a son. From that hour, even while continuing to
praise her virtues, Henry grew cold towards her person, and his
love by degrees changed into repugnance. And then he thought
that the death of his children might be a sign of God's anger.
This idea had taken hold of him, and induced him to occupy
apartments separate from the queen's.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S FIRST STEPS.</div>

<p>Wolsey judged the moment favourable for beginning the attack.
It was in the latter months of 1526, when calling Longland, the
king's confessor, to him, and concealing his principal motive, he
said: "You know his majesty's anguish. The stability of his
crown and his everlasting salvation seem to be compromised
alike. To whom can I unbosom myself, if not to you, who
must know the inmost secrets of his soul?" The two bishops
resolved to awaken Henry to the perils incurred by his union
with Catherine;<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> but Longland insisted that Wolsey should take
the first steps.</p>

<p>The cardinal waited upon the king, and reminded him of his
scruples before the betrothal; he exaggerated those entertained
by the nation, and speaking with unusual warmth, he entreated
the king to remain no longer in such danger:<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> "The holiness of
your life and the legitimacy of your succession are at stake."
"My good father," said Henry, "you would do well to consider
the weight of the stone that you have undertaken to move.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
The queen is a woman of such exemplary life that I have no
motive for separating from her."</p>

<p>The cardinal did not consider himself beaten; three days later
he appeared before the king accompanied by the bishop of Lincoln.
"Most mighty prince," said the confessor, who felt bold
enough to speak after the cardinal, "you cannot, like Herod,
have your brother's wife.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> I exhort and conjure you, as having
the care of your soul,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> to submit the matter to competent
judges." Henry consented, and perhaps not unwillingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY PROPOSES MARGARET.</div>

<p>It was not enough for Wolsey to separate Henry from the
emperor; he must, for greater security, unite him to Francis I.
The King of England shall repudiate the aunt of Charles V, and
then marry the sister of the French king. Proud of the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
he had obtained in the first part of his plan, Wolsey entered
upon the second. "There is a princess," he told the king, "whose
birth, graces, and talents charm all Europe. Margaret of Valois,
sister of King Francis, is superior to all of her sex, and no one
is worthier of your alliance."<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Henry made answer that it was
a serious matter, requiring deliberate examination. Wolsey,
however, placed in the king's hands a portrait of Margaret, and
it has been imagined that he even privily caused her sentiments
to be sounded. Be that as it may, the sister of Francis I having
learnt that she was pointed at as the future queen of England,
rebelled at the idea of taking from an innocent woman a crown
she had worn so nobly. "The French king's sister knows too
much of Christ to consent unto such wickedness," said Tyndale.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
Margaret of Valois replied: "Let me hear no more of a marriage
that can be effected only at the expense of Catherine of Aragon's
happiness and life."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The woman who was destined in future
years to fill the throne of England was then residing at Margaret's
court. Shortly after this, on the 24th of January 1527, the
sister of Francis I, married Henry d'Albret, king of Navarre.</p>

<p>Henry VIII, desirous of information with regard to his favourite's
suggestion, commissioned Fox, his almoner, Pace, dean of
St. Paul's, and Wakefield, professor of Hebrew at Oxford, to
study the passages of Leviticus and Deuteronomy which related
to marriage with a brother's wife. Wakefield, who had no wish
to commit himself, asked whether Henry was <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> the
divorce.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Pace replied to this servile hebraist that the king
wanted nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>But who would take the first public step in an undertaking
so hazardous? Every one shrank back; the terrible emperor
alarmed them all. It was a French bishop that hazarded the
step; bishops meet us at every turn in this affair of the divorce,
with which bishops have so violently reproached the Reformation.
Henry, desirous of excusing Wolsey, pretended afterwards
that the objections of the French prelate had preceded those of
Longland and the cardinal. In February 1527, Francis I, had
sent an embassy to London, at the head of which was Gabriel
de Grammont, bishop of Tarbes, with the intention to procure
the hand of Mary of England. Henry's ministers having inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
whether the engagements of Francis with the queen
dowager of Portugal did not oppose the commission with which
the French bishop was charged, the latter answered: "I will
ask you in turn what has been done to remove the impediments
which opposed the marriage of which the Princess Mary is issue."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
They laid before the ambassador the dispensation of Julius II,
which he returned, saying, that the bull was not <i>sufficient</i>, seeing
that such a marriage was forbidden <i>jure divino</i>,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> and he added:
"Have you English a different gospel from ours?"<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S UNEASINESS.</div>

<p>The king, when he heard these words (as he informs us himself),
was filled with fear and horror.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Three of the most respected
bishops of Christendom united to accuse him of incest!
He began to speak of it to certain individuals: "The scruples of
my conscience have been terribly increased (he said) since the
bishop spoke of this matter before my council in exceedingly
plain words."<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> There is no reason to believe that these <i>terrible</i>
troubles of which the king speaks were a mere invention on his
part. A disputed succession might again plunge England into
civil war. Even if no pretenders should spring up, might they
not see a rival house, a French prince for instance, wedded to
Henry's daughter, reigning over England? The king, in his
anxiety, had recourse to his favourite author, Thomas Aquinas,
and this <i>angel of the schools</i> declared his marriage unlawful.
Henry next opened the Bible, and found this threat against the
man who took his brother's wife: "He shall be <i>childless</i>!"
The denunciation increased his trouble, for he had no heir. In
the midst of this darkness a new perspective opened before him.
His conscience might be unbound; his desire to have a younger
wife might be gratified; he might have a son!... The
king resolved to lay the matter before a commission of lawyers,
and this commission soon wrote volumes.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CATHERINE'S ALARM.</div>

<p>During all this time Catherine, suspecting no evil, was
occupied in her devotions. Her heart, bruised by the death of
her children and by the king's coldness, sought consolation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
prayer both privately and in the royal chapel. She would rise
at midnight and kneel down upon the cold stones, and never
missed any of the canonical services. But one day (probably
in May or June 1527) some officious person informed her of the
rumours circulating in the city and at court. Bursting with
anger and alarm, and all in tears, she hastened to the king, and
addressed him with the bitterest complaints.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Henry was content
to calm her by vague assurances; but the unfeeling Wolsey,
troubling himself still less than his master about Catherine's
emotion, called it, with a smile, "a short tragedy."</p>

<p>The offended wife lost no time: it was necessary that the emperor
should be informed promptly, surely, and accurately of
this unprecedented insult. A letter would be insufficient, even
were it not intercepted. Catherine therefore determined to send
her servant Francis Philip, a Spaniard, to her nephew; and to
conceal the object of his journey, they proceeded, after the
<i>tragedy</i>, to play a <i>comedy</i> in the Spanish style. "My mother
is sick and desires to see me," said Philip. Catherine begged
the king to refuse her servant's prayer; and Henry, divining the
stratagem, resolved to employ trick against trick.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> "Philip's
request is very proper," he made answer; and Catherine, <i>from
regard to her husband</i>, consented to his departure. Henry meantime
had given orders that, "notwithstanding any safe conduct,
the said Philip should be arrested and detained at Calais, in
such a manner, however, that no one should know whence the
stoppage proceeded."</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that the queen indulged in a culpable
dissimulation; a poisoned arrow had pierced her heart, and her
words, her manners, her complaints, her tears, the numerous
messages she sent, now to one and now to another, betrayed
the secret which the king wished still to conceal.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Her friends
blamed her for this publicity; men wondered what Charles would
say when he heard of his aunt's distress; they feared that peace
would be broken; but Catherine, whose heart was "rent in
twain," was not to be moved by diplomatic considerations. Her
sorrow did not check Henry; with the two motives which made
him eager for a divorce&mdash;the scruples of his conscience and the
desire of an heir&mdash;was now combined a third still more forcible.
A woman was about to play an important part in the destinies
of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE BOLEYN AND LORD PERCY.</div>

<p>Anne Boleyn, who had been placed by her father at the
court of France, had returned to England with Sir Thomas,
then ambassador at Paris, at the time that an English army
made an incursion into Normandy (1522.) It would appear
that she was presented to the queen about this period, and appointed
one of Catherine's maids of honour. The following year
was a memorable one to her from her first sorrow.</p>

<p>Among the young noblemen in the cardinal's household was
Lord Percy, eldest son of the Earl of Northumberland. While
Wolsey was closeted with the king, Percy was accustomed to
resort to the queen's apartments, where he passed the time
among her ladies. He soon felt a sincere passion for Anne, and
the young maid of honour, who had been cold to the addresses
of the gentlemen at the court of Francis, replied to the affections
of the heir of Northumberland. The two young people already
indulged in day-dreams of a quiet, elegant, and happy life in
their noble castles of the north; but such dreams were fated to
be of short duration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY SEPARATES THE YOUNG LOVERS.</div>

<p>Wolsey hated the Norfolks, and consequently the Boleyns.
It was to counterbalance their influence that he had been first
introduced at court. He became angry, therefore, when he saw
one of his household suing for the hand of the daughter and
niece of his enemies. Besides, certain partisans of the clergy
accused Anne of being friendly to the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>...
It is generally believed that even at this period Wolsey had
discovered Henry's eyes turned complacently on the young maid
of honour, and that this induced him to thwart Percy's love;
but this seems improbable. Of all the women in England, Anne
was the one whose influence Wolsey would have had most cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to fear, and he really did fear it; and he would have been but
too happy to see her married to Percy. It has been asserted
that Henry prevailed on the cardinal to thwart the affection of
the two young people; but in that case did he confide to Wolsey
the real motive of his opposition? Did the latter entertain
criminal intentions? Did he undertake to yield up to dishonour
the daughter and niece of his political adversaries? This
would be horrible, but it is possible, and may even be deduced
from Cavendish's narrative; yet we will hope that it was not
so. If it were, Anne's virtue successfully baffled the infamous
plot.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, one day when Percy was in attendance
upon the cardinal, the latter rudely addressed him: "I marvel
at your folly, that you should attempt to contract yourself with
that girl without your father's or the king's consent. I command
you to break with her." Percy burst into tears, and besought
the cardinal to plead his cause. "I charge you to resort
no more into her company," was Wolsey's cold reply,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> after
which he rose up and left the room. Anne received an order at
the same time to leave the court. Proud and bold, and ascribing
her misfortune to Wolsey's hatred, she exclaimed as she
quitted the palace, "I will be revenged for this insult." But she
had scarcely taken up her abode in the gothic Halls of Hever
Castle, when news still more distressing overwhelmed her.
Percy was married to Lady Mary Talbot. She wept long and
bitterly, and vowed against the young nobleman who had deserted
her a contempt equal to her hatred of the cardinal. Anne was
reserved for a more illustrious, but more unhappy fate.</p>

<p>This event necessarily rendered her residence in this country
far from attractive to Anne Boleyn. "She did not stay
long in England," says Burnet, following Camden; "she served
queen Claude of France till her death, and after that she was
taken into service by King Francis' sister." Anne Boleyn, lady-in-waiting
to Margaret of Valois, was consoled at last. She indulged
in gaieties with all the vivacity of her age, and glittered
among the youngest and the fairest at all the court festivities.</p>

<p>In Margaret's house she met the most enlightened men of the
age, and her understanding and heart were developed simultaneously
with the graces. She began to read, without thoroughly
understanding it, the holy book in which her mistress (as Brantome
informs us) found consolation and repose, and to direct a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
few light and passing thoughts to that "mild Emmanuel," to
whom Margaret addressed such beautiful verses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAPTURE OF ROME&mdash;CROMWELL.</div>

<p>At last Anne returned definitively to England. It has been
asserted that the queen-regent, fearing that Henry after the
battle of Pavia would invade France, had sent Anne to London
to dissuade him from it. But it was a stronger voice than hers
which stopped the king of England. "Remain quiet," wrote
Charles V to him; "I have the stag in my net, and we have
only to think of sharing the spoils." Margaret of Valois having
married the king of Navarre at the end of January 1527, and
quitted Paris and her brother's court, it is supposed that Sir
Thomas Boleyn, who was unwilling that his daughter should
take up her abode in the Pyrenees, recalled her to England
probably in the winter or spring of the same year. "There is
not the least evidence that she came to it earlier," says a modern
author.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> She appeared once more at court, and the niece of the
Duke of Norfolk soon eclipsed her companions, "by her excellent
gesture and behaviour,"<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> as we learn from a contemporary
unfriendly to the Boleyns. All the court was struck by the
regularity of her features, the expression of her eyes, the gentleness
of her manners, and the majesty of her carriage.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> "She was a
beautiful creature," says an old historian, "well proportioned,
courteous, amiable, very agreeable, and a skilful musician."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>While entertainments were following close upon each other
at the court of Henry VIII, a strange rumour filled all England
with surprise. It was reported that the imperialist soldiers
had taken Rome by assault, and that some Englishmen were
among those who had mounted the breach. One Thomas Cromwell
was specially named<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>&mdash;the man who nearly twenty years
before had obtained certain indulgences from Julius II, by offering
him some jars of English confectionary. This soldier carried
with him the New Testament of Erasmus, and he is said to
have learnt it by heart during the campaign. Being gay, brave,
and intelligent, he entertained, from reading the gospel and seeing
Rome, a great aversion for the policy, superstitions, and disorders
of the popedom. The day of the 7th May 1527 decided
the tenor of his life. To destroy the papal power became his
dominant idea. On returning to England he entered the cardinal's
household.</p>

<p>However, the captive pope and cardinals wrote letters "filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with tears and groans."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Full of zeal for the papacy, Wolsey
ordered a public fast. "The emperor will never release the
pope, unless he be compelled," he told the king. "Sir, God
has made you <i>defender of the faith</i>; save the church and its
head!"&mdash;"My lord," answered the king with a smile, "I assure
you that this war between the emperor and the pope is not for
the faith, but for temporal possessions and dominions."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S EMBASSY TO FRANCE.</div>

<p>But Wolsey would not be discouraged; and, on the 3rd of
July, he passed through the streets of London, riding a richly
caparisoned mule, and resting his feet on gilt stirrups, while
twelve hundred gentlemen accompanied him on horseback. He
was going to entreat Francis to aid his master in saving Clement
VII. He had found no difficulty in prevailing upon Henry;
Charles talked of carrying the pope to Spain, and of permanently
establishing the apostolic see in that country.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> Now, how could
they obtain the divorce from a <i>Spanish</i> pope? During the procession,
Wolsey seemed oppressed with grief, and even shed tears;<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
but he soon raised his head and exclaimed: "My heart is inflamed,
and I wish that it may be said of the pope <i>per secula sempiterna</i>,</p>

<p class="center">
"Rediit Henrici octavi virtute serena."<br />
</p>

<p>Desirous of forming a close union between France and England
for the accomplishment of his designs, he had cast his eyes
on the princess Renée, daughter of Louis XII, and sister-in-law
to Francis I, as the future wife of Henry VIII. Accordingly
the treaty of alliance between the two crowns having been signed
at Amiens on the 18th of August (1527), Francis, with his
mother and the cardinal, proceeded to Compiégne, and there
Wolsey, styling Charles the most obstinate defender of Lutheranism,<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
promising "perpetual <i>conjunction</i> on the one hand [between
France and England], and perpetual <i>disjunction</i> on the
other." [between England and Germany],<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> demanded Renée's
hand for king Henry. Staffileo, dean of Rota, affirmed that the
pope had been able to permit the marriage between Henry and
Catherine only by an error of the keys of St. Peter.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> This avowal,
so remarkable on the part of the dean of one of the first jurisdictions
of Rome, induced Francis' mother to listen favourably
to the cardinal's demand. But whether this proposal was displeasing
to Renée, who was destined on a future day to profess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the pure faith of the Gospel with greater earnestness than
Margaret of Valois, or whether Francis was not over-anxious for
a union that would have given Henry rights over the duchy
of Brittany, she was promised to the son of the Duke of Ferrara.
It was a check to the cardinal; but it was his ill fortune to receive
one still more severe on his return to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE BOLEYN'S SUCCESS.</div>

<p>The daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, (who had been created
Viscount Rochford in 1525,) was constantly at court, "where
she nourished in great estimation and favour," says Cavendish,
"having always a private indignation against the cardinal for
breaking off the pre-contract made between Lord Percy and
her," little suspecting that Henry had had any share in it.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Her
beauty, her graceful carriage, her black hair, oval face, and
bright eyes, her sweet voice in singing, her skill and dignity in
the dance, her desire to please which was not entirely devoid of
coquetry, her sprightliness, the readiness of her repartees, and
above all the amiability of her character, won every heart. She
brought to Greenwich and to London the polished manners of
the court of Francis I. Every day (it was reported) she invented
a new style of dress, and set the fashion in England. But
to all these qualities, she added modesty, and even imposed it
on others by her example. The ladies of the court, who had
hitherto adopted a different fashion (says her greatest enemy),
covered the neck and bosom as she did;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> and the malicious, unable
to appreciate Anne's motives, ascribed this modesty on the
young lady's part to a desire to hide a secret deformity.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Numerous
admirers once more crowded round Anne Boleyn, and
among others, one of the most illustrious noblemen and poets of
England, Sir Thomas Wyatt, a follower of Wickliffe. He however,
was not the man destined to replace the son of the Percies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE REJECTS THE KING.</div>

<p>Henry, absorbed in anxiety about his divorce from Catherine,
had become low-spirited and melancholy. The laughter,
songs, repartees, and beauty of Anne Boleyn struck and captivated
him, and his eyes were soon fixed complacently on the
young maid of honour. Catherine was more than forty years
old, and it was hardly to be expected that so susceptible a man
as Henry would have made, as Job says, <i>a covenant with his eyes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
<i>not to think upon a maid</i>. Desirous of showing his admiration,
he presented Anne, according to usage, with a costly jewel; she
accepted and wore it, and continued to dance, laugh, and chatter
as before, without attaching particular importance to the royal
present. Henry's attentions became more continuous; and he
took advantage of a moment when he found Anne alone to declare
his sentiments. With mingled emotion and alarm, the
young lady fell trembling at the king's feet, and exclaimed,
bursting into tears: "I think, most noble and worthy king,
your majesty speaks these words in mirth to prove me....
I will rather lose my life than my virtue."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Henry gracefully
replied, that he should at least continue to hope. But Anne, rising
up, proudly made answer: "I understand not, most mighty
king, how you should retain any such hope; your wife I cannot
be, both in respect of mine own unworthiness, and also because
you have a queen already. Your mistress I will not be."
Anne kept her word. She continued to show the king, even
after this interview, all the respect that was due to him; but on
several occasions she proudly, violently even, repelled his advances.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
In this age of gallantry, we find her resisting for nearly
six years all the seductions Henry scattered round her. Such
an example is not often met with in the history of courts. The
books she had read in Margaret's palace gave her a secret
strength. All looked upon her with respect; and even the queen
treated her with politeness. Catherine showed, however, that
she had remarked the king's preference. One day, as she was
playing at cards with her maid of honour, while Henry was in
the room, Anne frequently holding the <i>king</i>, she said: "My
Lady Anne, you have good hap to stop ever at a <i>king</i>; but
you are not like others, you will have all or none." Anne
blushed: from that moment Henry's attentions acquired more
importance; she resolved to withdraw from them, and quitted the
court with Lady Rochford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S LETTER TO ANNE.</div>

<p>The king, who was not accustomed to resistance, was extremely
grieved; and having learnt that Anne would not return to the
court either with or without her mother, sent a courier to Hever
with a message and a letter for her. If we recollect the manners
of the age of Henry VIII, and how far the men, in their relations
with the gentler sex, were strangers to that reserve which society
now imposes upon them, we cannot but be struck by the king's
respectful tone: He writes thus in French:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>"As the time seems to me very long since I heard from you
or concerning your health, the great love I have for you has
constrained me to send this bearer to be better informed both
of your health and pleasure; particularly, because since my last
parting with you, I have been told that you have entirely
changed the mind in which I left you, and that you neither
mean to come to court with your mother nor any other
way; which report, if true, I cannot enough marvel at, being
persuaded in my own mind that I have never committed any
offence against you; and it seems hard, in return for the great
love I bear you, to be kept at a distance from the person and
presence of the woman in the world that I value the most. And
if you love me with as much affection as I hope you do, I am
sure the distance of our two persons would be equally irksome
to you, though this does not belong so much to the mistress as
to the servant.</p>

<p>"Consider well, my mistress, how greatly your absence afflicts
me. I hope it is not your will that it should be so; but if I
heard for certain that you yourself desired it, I could but mourn
my ill-fortune, and strive by degrees to abate of my great
folly.</p>

<p>"And so for lack of time I make an end of this rude letter,
beseeching you to give the bearer credence in all he will tell
you from me. Written by the hand of your entire servant,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>The word <i>servant</i> (serviteur) employed in this letter explains
the sense in which Henry used the word <i>mistress</i>. In the language
of chivalry, the latter term expressed a person to whom
the lover had surrendered his heart.</p>

<p>It would seem that Anne's reply to this letter was the same
she had made to the king from the very first; and Cardinal Pole
mentions more than once her obstinate refusal of an adulterous
love.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> At last Henry understood Anne's virtue; but he was
far from <i>abating of his great folly</i>, as he had promised. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
tyrannical selfishness, which the prince often displayed in his
life, was shown particularly in his amours. Seeing that he
could not attain his end by illegitimate means, he determined
to break, as quickly as possible, the bonds which united him
to the queen. Anne's virtue was the third cause of Henry's
divorce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>His resolution being once taken, it must needs be carried out.
Henry having succeeded in bringing Anne back to court, procured
a private interview with her, offered her his crown, and
seizing her hand, took off one of her rings. But Anne, who
would not be the king's mistress, refused also to be his wife.
The glory of a crown could not dazzle her, said Wyatt, and two
motives in particular counterbalanced all the prospects of greatness
which were set before her eyes. The first was her respect
for the queen: "How could I injure a princess of such great
virtue?" she exclaimed.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> The second was the fear that a union
with "one that was her lord and her king," would not give her
that freedom of heart and that liberty which she would enjoy
by marrying a man of the same rank with herself.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>Yet the noblemen and ladies of Henry's court whispered to
one another that Anne would certainly become queen of England.
Some were tormented by jealousy; others, her friends,
were delighted at the prospect of a rapid advancement. Wolsey's
enemies in particular were charmed at the thought of ruining
the favourite. It was at the very moment when all these emotions
were so variously agitating the court that the cardinal,
returning from his embassy to Francis, re-appeared in London,
where an unexpected blow struck him.</p>

<p>Wolsey was expressing his grief to Henry at having failed in
obtaining either Margaret or Renée for him, when the king interrupted
him: "Console yourself, I shall marry Anne Boleyn."
The cardinal remained speechless for a moment. What would
become of him, if the king placed the crown of England on the
head of the daughter and niece of his greatest enemies? What
would become of the church, if a second Anne of Bohemia should
ascend the throne? Wolsey threw himself at the feet of his
master, and entreated him to renounce so fatal a project.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> It
was then no doubt that he remained (as he afterwards said) <i>an
hour or two</i> on his knees before the king in his privy chamber,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
but without prevailing on Henry to give up his design. Wolsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
persuaded that if he continued openly to oppose Henry's will, he
would for ever lose his confidence, dissembled his vexation,
waiting an opportunity to get rid of this unfortunate rival by
some intrigue. He began by writing to the pope, informing
him that a young lady, brought up by the queen of Navarre,
and consequently tainted by the Lutheran heresy, had captivated
the king's heart;<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and from that hour Anne Boleyn became the
object of the hatred and calumnies of Rome. But at the same
time, to conceal his intentions, Wolsey received Henry at a series
of splendid entertainments, at which Anne outshone all the ladies
of the court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY'S PREACHING.</div>

<p>While these passions were agitating Henry's palace, the most
moving scenes, produced by Christian faith, were stirring the
nation. Bilney, animated by that courage which God sometimes
gives to the weakest men, seemed to have lost his natural timidity,
and preached for a time with an energy quite apostolic.
He taught that all men should first acknowledge their sins and
condemn them, and then hunger and thirst after that righteousness
which Jesus Christ gives.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> To this testimony borne to the
truth, he added his testimony against error. "These five hundred
years," he added, "there hath been no good pope; and in
all the times past we can find but fifty: for they have neither
preached nor lived well, nor conformably to their dignity;
wherefore, unto this day, they have borne the keys of simony."<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY ARRESTED.</div>

<p>As soon as he descended from the pulpit, this pious scholar,
with his friend Arthur, visited the neighbouring towns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
villages. "The Jews and Saracens would long ago have become
believers," he once said at Wilsdown, "had it not been
for the idolatry of Christian men in offering candles, wax, and
money to stocks and stones." One day when he visited Ipswich,
where there was a Franciscan convent, he exclaimed: "The
cowl of St. Francis wrapped round a dead body hath no power
to take away sins.... <i>Ecce agnus Dei qui tollit peccata
mundi.</i>" (John i, 29.) The poor monks, who were little versed
in Scripture, had recourse to the <i>Almanac</i> to convict the <i>Bible</i>
of error. "St. Paul did rightly affirm," said Friar John Brusierd,
"that there is but one mediator of God and man, because
as yet there was no <i>saint</i> canonized or put into the calendar."&mdash;"Let
us ask of the Father in the name of the Son," rejoined
Bilney, "and he will give unto us."&mdash;"You are always speaking
of the Father and never of the <i>saints</i>," replied the friar; "you
are like a man who has been looking so long upon the sun that
he can see nothing else."<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> As he uttered these words the monk
seemed bursting with anger. "If I did not know that the saints
would take everlasting vengeance upon you, I would surely with
these nails of mine be your death."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Twice in fact did two
monks pull him out of his pulpit. He was arrested and taken
to London.</p>

<p>Arthur, instead of fleeing, began to visit the flocks which his
friend had converted. "Good people," said he, "if I should
suffer persecution for the preaching of the Gospel, there are
seven thousand more that would preach it as I do now. Therefore,
good people! good people!" (and he repeated these words
several times in a sorrowful voice) "think not that if these
tyrants and persecutors put a man to death, the preaching of
the Gospel therefore is to be forsaken. Every Christian man,
yea every layman, is a priest. Let our adversaries preach by
the authority of the cardinal; others by the authority of the
university; others by the pope's; we will preach by the authority
of God. It is not the man who brings the word that saves the
soul, but the word which the man brings. Neither bishops nor
popes have the right to forbid any man to preach the Gospel;<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> and
if they kill him he is not a heretic but a martyr."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The priests
were horrified at such doctrines. In their opinion, there was no
God out of their church, no salvation out of their sacrifices.
Arthur was thrown into the same prison as Bilney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY AND ARTHUR BEFORE THE BISHOP.</div>

<p>On the 27th of November 1527 the cardinal and the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Canterbury, with a great number of bishops, divines,
and lawyers, met in the chapter-house of Westminster, when
Bilney and Arthur were brought before them. But the king's
prime minister thought it beneath his dignity to occupy his
time with miserable heretics. Wolsey had hardly commenced
the examination, when he rose, saying: "The affairs of the realm
call me away; all such as are found guilty, you will compel
them to abjure, and those who rebel you will deliver over to the
secular power." After a few questions proposed by the bishop
of London, the two accused men were led back to prison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY'S STRUGGLE.</div>

<p>Abjuration or death&mdash;that was Wolsey's order. But the
conduct of the trial was confided to Tonstall; Bilney conceived
some hope.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> "Is it possible," he said to himself, "that the
bishop of London, the friend of Erasmus, will gratify the monks?...
I must tell him that it was the Greek Testament of
his learned master that led me to the faith." Upon which the
humble evangelist having obtained paper and ink, set about
writing to the bishop from his gloomy prison those admirable
letters which have been transmitted to posterity. Tonstall, who
was not a cruel man, was deeply moved, and then a strange
struggle took place: a judge wishing to save the prisoner, the
prisoner desiring to give up his life. Tonstall, by acquitting
Bilney, had no desire to compromise himself. "Submit to the
church," said the bishop, "for God speaks only through it."
But Bilney, who knew that God speaks in the Scriptures, remained
inflexible. "Very well, then," said Tonstall, taking up
the prisoner's eloquent letters, "in discharge of my conscience I
shall lay these letters before the court." He hoped, perhaps,
that they would touch his colleagues, but he was deceived. He
determined, therefore, to make a fresh attempt. On the 4th
of December, Bilney was brought again before the court. "Abjure
your errors," said Tonstall. Bilney refusing by a shake of
the head, the bishop continued: "Retire into the next room
and consider." Bilney withdrew, and returning shortly after
with joy beaming in his eyes, Tonstall thought he had gained
the victory. "You will return to the church, then?" said he....
The doctor answered calmly: "<i>Fiat judicium in nomine
Domini</i>."<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> "Be quick," continued the bishop, "this is the
last moment, and you will be condemned." "<i>Hæc est dies quam
fecit Dominus</i>," answered Bilney, "<i>exultemus et lætemur in ea</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
(Psalm cxviii, 24). Upon this Tonstall took off his cap, and
said: "<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti....
Exsurgat Deus et dissipentur inimici ejus!</i>" (Ps. lxviii, 1).
Then making the sign of the cross on his forehead and on his
breast, he gave judgment: "Thomas Bilney, I pronounce thee
convicted of heresy." He was about to name the penalty ...
a last hope restrained him; he stopped: "For the rest
of the sentence we take deliberation until to-morrow." Thus
was the struggle prolonged between two men, one of whom desired
to walk to the stake, the other to bar the way as it were
with his own body.</p>

<p>"Will you return to the unity of the church?" asked Tonstall
the next day. "I hope I was never separated from the church,"
answered Bilney. "Go and consult with some of your friends,"
said the bishop, who was resolved to save his life; "I will give
you till one o'clock in the afternoon." In the afternoon Bilney
made the same answer. "I will give you two nights' respite
to deliberate," said the bishop; "on Saturday at nine o'clock in
the forenoon, the court will expect a plain definitive answer."
Tonstall reckoned on the night with its dreams, its anguish, and
its terrors, to bring about Bilney's recantation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY'S FALL.</div>

<p>This extraordinary struggle occupied many minds both in
court and city. Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII watched with
interest the various phases of this tragic history. What will
happen? was the general question. Will he give way? Shall we
see him live or die? One day and two nights still remained;
everything was tried to shake the Cambridge doctor. His friends
crowded to his prison; he was overwhelmed with arguments and
examples; but an inward struggle, far more terrible than
those without, agitated the pious Bilney. "Whoever will save
his soul shall lose it," Christ had said. That selfish love of his
soul, which is found even in the advanced Christian,&mdash;that self,
which after his conversion had been not absorbed, but overruled
by the Spirit of God, gradually recovered strength in his
heart, in the presence of disgrace and death. His friends who
wished to save him, not understanding that the fallen Bilney
would be Bilney no longer, conjured him with tears to have pity
on himself; and by these means his firmness was overcome. The
bishop pressed him, and Bilney asked himself: "Can a young
soldier like me know the rules of war better than an old soldier
like Tonstall? Or can a poor silly sheep know his way to the
fold better than the chief pastor of London?"<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> His friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
quitted him neither night nor day, and entangled by their fatal
affection, he believed at last that he had found a compromise
which would set his conscience at rest. "I will preserve my
life," he said, "to dedicate it to the Lord." This delusion had
scarcely laid hold of his mind before his views were confused,
his faith was vailed, the Holy Ghost departed from him, God
gave him over to his carnal thoughts, and under the pretext of
being useful to Jesus Christ for many years, Bilney disobeyed
him at the present moment. Being led before the bishops on
the morning of Saturday the 7th of December, at nine o'clock,
he fell ... (Arthur had fallen before him), and whilst the false
friends who had misled him hardly dared raise their eyes, the
living church of Christ in England uttered a cry of anguish.
"If ever you come in danger," said Latimer, "for God's quarrel,
I would advise you, above all things, to abjure all your friendships;
leave not one unabjured. It is they that shall undo you,
and not your enemies. It was his very friends that brought
Bilney to it."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>On the following day (Sunday, 8th December) Bilney was
placed at the head of a procession, and the fallen disciple, bareheaded,
with a fagot on his shoulders, stood in front of St.
Paul's cross, while a priest from the pulpit exhorted him to repentance;
after which he was led back to prison.</p>

<p>What a solitude for the wretched man! At one time the
cold darkness of his cell appeared to him as a burning fire; at
another he fancied he heard accusing voices crying to him in
the silence of the night. Death, the very enemy he had wished
to avoid, fixed his icy glance upon him and filled him with fear.
He strove to escape from the horrible spectre, but in vain.
Then the friends who had dragged him into this abyss, crowded
round and endeavoured to console him; but if they gave utterance
to any of Christ's gentle promises, Bilney started back with
affright and shrank to the farthest part of the dungeon, with a
cry "as though a man had run him through the heart with a
sword."<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Having denied the word of God, he could no longer
endure to hear it. The curse of the Apocalypse: <i>Ye mountains,
hide me from the wrath of the Lamb!</i> was the only passage of
Scripture in harmony with his soul. His mind wandered, the
blood froze in his veins, he sank under his terrors; he lost all
sense, and almost his life, and lay motionless in the arms of his
astonished friends. "God," exclaimed those unhappy individuals
who had caused his fall, "God, by a just judgment, delivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
up to the tempests of their conscience all who deny his
truth."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAYFIELD ARRESTED.</div>

<p>This was not the only sorrow of the church. As soon as
Richard Bayfield, the late chamberlain of Bury, had joined
Tyndale and Fryth, he said to them: "I am at your disposal;
you shall be my head and I will be your hand; I will sell your
books and those of the German reformers in the Low Countries,
France, and England." It was not long indeed before he returned
to London. But Pierson, the priest whom he had
formerly met in Lombard Street, found him again, and accused
him to the bishop. The unhappy man was brought before
Tonstall. "You are charged," said the prelate, "with having
asserted that praise is due to God alone, and not to saints or
creatures."<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Bayfield acknowledged the charge to be true.
"You are accused of maintaining that every priest may preach
the word of God by the authority of the Gospel without the
license of the pope or cardinals." This also Bayfield acknowledged.
A penance was imposed on him; and then he was sent
back to his monastery with orders to show himself there on the
25th of April. But he crossed the sea once more, and hastened
to join Tyndale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOURTH EDITION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</div>

<p>The New Testaments, however, sold by him and others, remained
in England. At that time the bishops subscribed to
suppress the Scriptures, as so many persons have since done to
circulate them; and, accordingly, a great number of the copies
brought over by Bayfield and his friends were brought up.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> A
scarcity of food was erelong added to the scarcity of the word
of God; for as the cardinal was endeavouring to foment a war
between Henry and the emperor, the Flemish ships ceased to
enter the English ports. It was in consequence of this that the
lord mayor and aldermen of London hastened to express their
apprehensions to Wolsey almost before he had recovered from
the fatigues of his return from France. "Fear nothing," he
told them; "the king of France assured me, that if he had
three bushels of wheat, England should have two of them."
But none arrived, and the people were on the point of breaking
out into violence, when a fleet of ships suddenly appeared off
the mouth of the Thames. They were German and Flemish
vessels laden with corn, in which the worthy people of the Low
Countries had also concealed the New Testament. An Antwerp
bookseller, named John Raimond or Ruremond, from his birthplace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had printed a fourth edition more beautiful than the
previous ones. It was enriched with references and engravings
on wood, and each page bordered with red lines. Raimond
himself had embarked on board one of the ships with five hundred
copies of his New Testament.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> About Christmas 1527,
the book of God was circulated in England along with the
bread that nourishes the body. But certain priests and monks
having discovered the Scriptures among the sacks of corn, they
carried several copies to the bishop of London, who threw Raimond
into prison. The greater part, however, of the new
edition escaped him. The New Testament was read everywhere,
and even the court did not escape the contagion. Anne Boleyn,
notwithstanding her smiling face, often withdrew to her closet
at Greenwich or at Hampton Court, to study the Gospel.
Frank, courageous, and proud, she did not conceal the pleasure
she found in such reading; her boldness astonished the courtiers,
and exasperated the clergy. In the city things went still
farther: the New Testament was explained in frequent conventicles,
particularly in the house of one Russell, and great was
the joy among the faithful. "It is sufficient only to enter
London," said the priests, "to become a heretic!" The Reformation
was taking root among the people before it arrived at
the upper classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPERY INTERCEPTS THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>The sun of the word of God, which daily grew brighter in
the sky of the sixteenth century, was sufficient to scatter all
the darkness in England; but popery, like an immense wall, intercepted
its rays. Britain had hardly received the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in Greek and Latin, and then in English, before the priests began
to make war upon them with indefatigable zeal. It was
necessary that the wall should be thrown down in order that the
sun might penetrate freely among the Anglo-Saxon people. And
new events were ripening in England, destined to make a great
breach in popery. The negotiations of Henry VIII with Clement
VII play an important part in the Reformation. By
showing up the Court of Rome, they destroyed the respect which
the people felt for it; they took away that <i>power and strength</i>
as Scripture says, which the monarchy had given it; and the
throne of the pope once fallen in England, Jesus Christ uplifted
and strengthened his own.</p>

<p>Henry, ardently desiring an heir, and thinking that he had
found the woman that would ensure his own and England's
happiness, conceived the design of severing the ties that united
him to the queen, and with this view he consulted his most
favourite councillors about the divorce. There was one in particular
whose approval he coveted: this was Sir Thomas More.
One day as Erasmus's friend was walking with his master in the
beautiful gallery at Hampton Court, giving him an account of
a mission he had just executed on the continent, the king suddenly
interrupted him: "My marriage to the queen," he said,
"is contrary to the laws of God, of the church, and of nature."
He then took up the Bible, and pointed out the passages in his
favour.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> "I am not a theologian," said More, somewhat embarrassed;
"your majesty should consult a council of doctors."</p>

<p>Accordingly, by Henry's order, Warham assembled the most
learned canonists at Hampton Court; but weeks passed away
before they could agree.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Most of them quoted in the king's
favour those passages in Leviticus (xviii, 16; xx, 21,) which forbid
a man to take <i>his brother's wife</i>.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> But Fisher, bishop of
Rochester, and the other opponents of the divorce, replied that,
according to Deuteronomy (xxv, 5,) when a woman is left a
widow without children, her brother-in-law ought to take her
to wife, to perpetuate his brother's name in Israel. "This law
concerned the Jews only," replied the partisans of the divorce;
they added that its object was "to maintain the inheritances
distinct, and the genealogies intact, until the coming of Christ.
The Judaical dispensation has passed away; but the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Leviticus, which is a moral law, is binding upon all men in all
ages."</p>

<p>To free themselves from their embarrassment, the bishops
demanded that the most eminent universities should be consulted;
and commissioners were forthwith despatched to Oxford,
Cambridge, Paris, Orleans, Toulouse, Louvain, Padua, and Bologna,
furnished with money to reward the foreign doctors for
the time and trouble this question would cost them. This
caused some little delay, and every means was now to be tried
to divert the king from his purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLARKE'S OBJECTION.</div>

<p>Wolsey, who was the first to suggest the idea of a divorce,
was now thoroughly alarmed. It appeared to him that a nod
from the daughter of the Boleyns would hurl him from the post
he had so laboriously won, and this made him vent his ill-humour
on all about him, at one time threatening Warham, and at
another persecuting Pace. But fearing to oppose Henry openly,
he summoned from Paris, Clarke, bishop of Bath and Wells, at
that time ambassador to the French court. The latter entered
into his views, and after cautiously preparing the way, he
ventured to say to the king: "The progress of the inquiry will
be so slow, your majesty, that it will take more than seven
years to bring it to an end!"&mdash;"Since my patience has already
held out for <i>eighteen</i> years," the king replied coldly, "I am willing
to wait <i>four</i> or <i>five</i> more."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUR DOCUMENTS REQUIRED OF THE POPE.</div>

<p>As the political party had failed, the clerical party set in
motion a scheme of another kind. A young woman, Elizabeth
Barton, known as <i>the holy maid of Kent</i>, had been subject from
childhood to epileptic fits. The priest of her parish, named
Masters, had persuaded her that she was inspired of God, and
confederating with one Bocking, a monk of Canterbury, he
turned the weakness of the prophetess to account. Elizabeth
wandered over the country, passing from house to house, and
from convent to convent; on a sudden her limbs would become
rigid, her features distorted; violent convulsions shook her body,
and strange unintelligible sounds fell from her lips, which the
amazed by-standers received as revelations from the Virgin and
the saints. Fisher, bishop of Rochester, Abel, the queen's
ecclesiastical agent, and even Sir Thomas More, were among the
number of Elizabeth's partisans. Rumours of the divorce having
reached the <i>saint's</i> ears, an angel commanded her to appear
before the cardinal. As soon as she stood in his presence, the
colour fled from her cheeks, her limbs trembled, and falling into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
an ecstasy, she exclaimed: "Cardinal of York, God has placed
three swords in your hand: the spiritual sword, to range the
church under the authority of the pope; the civil sword, to
govern the realm; and the sword of justice, to prevent the divorce
of the king.... If you do not wield these three swords
faithfully, God will lay it sore to your charge."<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> After these
words the prophetess withdrew.</p>

<p>But other influences were then dividing Wolsey's breast:
hatred, which induced him to oppose the divorce; and ambition,
which foreboded his ruin in this opposition. At last ambition
prevailed, and he resolved to make his objections forgotten by
the energy of his zeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE CANNOT ERR.</div>

<p>Henry hastened to profit by this change. "Declare the
divorce yourself," said he to Wolsey, "has not the pope named
you his vicar-general."<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The cardinal was not anxious to raise
himself so high. "If I were to decide the affair," said he, "the
queen would appeal to the pope; we must therefore either apply to
the holy father for special powers, or persuade the queen to retire
to a nunnery. And if we fail in either of these expedients,
we will obey the voice of conscience, even in despite of the
pope."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> It was arranged to begin with the more regular
attempt, and Gregory Da Casale, secretary Knight, and the
prothonotary Gambara, were appointed to an extraordinary
mission at the pontifical court. Casale was Wolsey's man, and
Knight was Henry's. Wolsey told the envoys: "You will
demand of the pope, <i>1stly</i>, a <i>commission</i> authorizing me to inquire
into this matter; <i>2ndly</i>, his promise to pronounce the
nullity of Catherine's marriage with Henry, if we should find
that her marriage with Arthur was consummated; and <i>3rdly</i>, a
<i>dispensation</i> permitting the king to marry again." In this
manner Wolsey hoped to make sure of the divorce without
damaging the papal authority. It was insinuated that false
representations, with regard to the consummation of the first
marriage, had been sent from England to Julius II, which had
induced the pontiff to permit the second. The pope being
deceived as to the <i>fact</i>, his infallibility was untouched. Wolsey
desired something more; knowing that no confidence could be
put in the good faith of the pontiff, he demanded a fourth instrument
by which the pope should bind himself <i>never to recall</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<i>the other three</i>; he only forgot to take precautions in case Clement
should withdraw <i>the fourth</i>. "With these four snares, skilfully
combined," said the cardinal, "I shall catch the hare; if he
escapes from one, he will fall into the other." The courtiers
anticipated a speedy termination of the affair. Was not the
emperor the declared enemy of the pontiff? Had not Henry,
on the contrary, made himself <i>protector of the Clementine league</i>?
Could Clement hesitate, when called upon, to choose between
his jailor and his benefactor?</p>

<p>Indeed, Charles V, at this moment, was in a very embarrassing
position. It is true, his guards were posted at the gates of
the castle of St. Angelo, where Clement was a prisoner, and
people in Rome said to one another with a smile: "Now indeed
it is true, <i>Papa non potest errare</i>."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> But it was not possible to
keep the pope a prisoner in Rome; and then what was to be
done with him? The viceroy of Naples proposed to Alercon,
the governor of St. Angelo, to remove Clement to Gæta; but
the affrighted colonel exclaimed: "Heaven forbid that I should
drag after me the very body of God!" Charles thought one
time of transporting the pontiff to Spain; but might not an
enemy's fleet carry him off on the road? The pope in prison
was far more embarrassing to Charles than the pope at
liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CONFERENCE AT ST. ANGELO.</div>

<p>It was at this critical time that Francis Philip, Queen Catherine's
servant, having escaped the snares laid by Henry VIII
and Wolsey, arrived at Madrid, where he passed a whole day in
conference with Charles V. This prince was at first astonished,
shocked even, by the designs of the king of England. The
curse of God seemed to hang over his house. His mother was
a lunatic; his sister of Denmark expelled from her dominions;
his sister of Hungary made a widow by the battle of Mohacz;
the Turks were encroaching upon his territories; Lautrec was
victorious in Italy, and the catholics, irritated by the pope's
captivity, detested his ambition. This was not enough. Henry
VIII was striving to divorce his aunt, and the pope would naturally
give his aid to this criminal design. Charles must choose
between the pontiff and the king. The friendship of the king
of England might aid him in breaking the league formed to
expel him from Italy, and by sacrificing Catherine he would be
sure to obtain his support; but placed between reasons of state
and his aunt's honour, the emperor did not hesitate; he even renounced
certain projects of reform that he had at heart. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
suddenly decided for the pope, and from that very hour followed
a new course.</p>

<p>Charles, who possessed great discernment, had understood his
age; he had seen that concessions were called for by the movement
of the human mind, and would have desired to carry out
the change from the middle ages to modern times by a carefully
managed transition. He had consequently demanded a
council to reform the church and weaken the Romish dominion
in Europe. But very different was the result. If Charles
turned away from Henry, he was obliged to turn towards Clement;
and after having compelled the head of the church to
enter a prison, it was necessary to place him once more upon
the throne. Charles V sacrificed the interests of Christian
society to the interests of his own family. This divorce, which
in England has been looked upon as the ruin of the popedom,
was what saved it in continental Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KNIGHT HURRIES FROM ROME.</div>

<p>But how could the emperor win the heart of the pontiff, filled
as it was with bitterness and anger? He selected for this
difficult mission a friar of great ability, De Angelis, general of
the Spanish Observance, and ordered him to proceed to the
castle of St. Angelo under the pretext of negotiating the liberation
of the holy father. The cordelier was conducted to the
strongest part of the fortress, called the Rock, where Clement
was lodged; and the two priests brought all their craft to bear
on each other. The monk, assisted by the artful Moncade,
adroitly mingled together the pope's deliverance and Catherine's
marriage. He affirmed that the emperor wished to open the
gates of the pontiff's prison, and had already given the order;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
and then he added immediately: "The emperor is determined
to maintain the rights of his aunt, and will never consent to the
divorce."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>&mdash;"If you are a <i>good shepherd</i> to me," wrote Charles
to the pope with his own hand on the 22nd of November, "I
will be a <i>good sheep</i> to you." Clement smiled as he read these
words; he understood his position; the emperor had need of the
priest, Charles was at his captive's feet; Clement was saved!
The divorce was a rope fallen from the skies which could not fail
to drag him out of the pits; he had only to cling to it quietly
in order to reascend his throne. Accordingly from that hour
Clement appeared less eager to quit the castle than Charles to
liberate him. "So long as the divorce is in suspense," thought
the crafty De' Medici, "I have two great friends; but as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
as I declare for one, I shall have a mortal enemy in the other."
He promised the monk to come to no decision in the matter
without informing the emperor.</p>

<p>Meantime Knight, the envoy of the impatient monarch, having
heard, as he crossed the Alps, that the pope was at liberty,
hastened on to Parma, where he met Gambara: "He is not
free yet," replied the prothonotary; "but the general of the
Franciscans hopes to terminate his captivity in a few days.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
Continue your journey," he added. Knight could not do so
without great danger. He was told at Foligno, sixty miles from
the metropolis, that if he had not a safe-conduct he could not
reach Rome without exposing his life; Knight halted. Just
then a messenger from Henry brought him despatches more
pressing than ever; Knight started again with one servant and
a guide. At Monte Rotondo he was nearly murdered by the
inhabitants; but on the next day (25th November), protected
by a violent storm of wind and rain,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> Henry's envoy entered
Rome at ten o'clock without being observed, and kept himself
concealed.</p>

<p>It was impossible to speak with Clement, for the emperor's
orders were positive. Knight, therefore, began to <i>practise</i> upon
the cardinals; he gained over the Cardinal of Pisa, by whose
means his despatches were laid before the pontiff. Clement
after reading them laid them down with a smile of satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
"Good!" said he, "here is <i>the other</i> coming to me now!" But
night had hardly closed in before the Cardinal of Pisa's secretary
hastened to Knight and told him: "Don Alercon is
informed of your arrival; and the pope entreats you to depart
immediately." This officer had scarcely left him, when the
prothonotary Gambara arrived in great agitation: "His holiness
presses you to leave; as soon as he is at liberty, he will
attend to your master's request." Two hours after this, two
hundred Spanish soldiers arrived, surrounded the house in
which Knight had concealed himself, and searched it from top
to bottom, but to no purpose; the English agent had escaped.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING'S REMORSE.</div>

<p>Knight's safety was not the true motive which induced Clement
to urge his departure. The very day on which the pope
received the message from the king of England, he signed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
treaty with Charles V, restoring him, under certain conditions,
to both his powers. At the same time the pontiff, for greater
security, pressed the French general Lautrec to hasten his march
to Rome in order to save him from the hands of the emperor.
Clement, a disciple of Machiavelli, thus gave the right hand to
Charles and the left to Francis; and as he had not another for
Henry, he made him the most positive promises. Each of the
three princes could reckon on the pope's friendship, and on the
same grounds.</p>

<p>The 10th of December (1527) was the day on which Clement's
imprisonment would terminate; but he preferred owing
his freedom to intrigue rather than to the emperor's generosity.
He therefore procured the dress of a tradesman, and, on the
evening before the day fixed for his deliverance, his ward being
already much relaxed, he escaped from the castle, and, accompanied
only by Louis of Gonzago in his flight, he made his way
to Orvieto.</p>

<p>While Clement was experiencing all the joy of a man just
escaped from prison, Henry was a prey to the most violent agitation.
Having ceased to love Catherine, he persuaded himself
that he was the victim of his father's ambition, a martyr to
duty, and the champion of conjugal sanctity. His very gait
betrayed his vexation, and even among the gay conversation of
the court, deep sighs would escape from his bosom. He had
frequent interviews with Wolsey. "I regard the safety of my
soul above all things,"<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> he said; "but I am concerned also for
the peace of my kingdom. For a long while an unceasing remorse
has been gnawing at my conscience,<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> and my thoughts
dwell upon my marriage with unutterable sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> God, in his
wrath, has taken away my sons, and if I persevere in this unlawful
union, he will visit me with still more terrible chastisements.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
My only hope is in the holy father." Wolsey replied
with a low bow: "Please your majesty, I am occupied with
this business, as if it were my only means of winning heaven."</p>

<p>And indeed he redoubled his exertions. He wrote to Sir
Gregory Da Casale on the 5th of December (1527): "You will
procure an audience of the pope at any price. Disguise yourself,
appear before him as the servant of some nobleman,<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> or as
a messenger from the duke of Ferrara. Scatter money plentifully;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
sacrifice every thing, provided you procure a secret interview
with his holiness; ten thousand ducats are at your disposal.
You will explain to Clement the king's scruples, and the necessity
of providing for the continuance of his house and the peace
of his kingdom. You will tell him that in order to restore him
to liberty, the king is ready to declare war against the emperor,
and thus show himself to all the world to be a true son of the
church."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S ALTERNATIVE.</div>

<p>Wolsey saw clearly that it was essential to represent the
divorce to Clement VII, as a means likely to secure the safety
of the popedom. The cardinal, therefore, wrote again to Da
Casale on the 6th of December: "Night and day, I revolve in
my mind the actual condition of the church,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and seek the
means best calculated to extricate the pope from the gulf into
which he has fallen. While I was turning these thoughts over
in my mind during a sleepless night ... one way suddenly
occurred to me. I said to myself, the king must be prevailed
upon to undertake the defence of the holy father. This was no
easy matter, for his majesty is strongly attached to the emperor;<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
however, I set about my task. I told the king that his holiness
was ready to satisfy him; I staked my honour; I succeeded.... To
save the pope, my master will sacrifice his treasures, subjects,
kingdom, and even his life.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>... I therefore conjure his
holiness to entertain our just demand."</p>

<p>Never before had such pressing entreaties been made to a
pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGLISH ENVOYS AT ORVIETO.</div>

<p>The envoys of the king of England appeared in the character
of the saviours of Rome. This was doubtless no stratagem; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Wolsey probably regarded that thought as coming from heaven,
which had visited him during the weary sleepless night. The
zeal of his agents increased. The pope was hardly set at liberty,
before Knight and Da Casale appeared at the foot of the precipitous
rock on which Orvieto is built, and demanded to be introduced
to Clement VII. Nothing could be more compromising
to the pontiff than such a visit. How could he appear on good
terms with England, when Rome and all his states were still in
the hands of Catherine's nephew? The pope's mind was utterly
bewildered by the demand of the two envoys. He recovered
however; to reject the powerful hand extended to him by England,
was not without its danger; and as he well knew how to
bring a difficult negotiation to a successful conclusion, Clement
regained confidence in his skill, and gave orders to introduce
Henry's ambassadors.</p>

<p>Their discourse was not without eloquence: "Never was the
church in a more critical position," said they. "The unmeasured
ambition of the kings who claim to dispose of spiritual
affairs at their own pleasure (this was aimed at Charles V) holds
the apostolical bark suspended over an abyss. The only port
open to it in the tempest is the favour of the august prince
whom we represent, and who has always been the shield of the
faith. But, alas! this monarch, the impregnable bulwark of
your holiness, is himself the prey of tribulations almost equal to
your own. His conscience torn by remorse, his crown without
an heir, his kingdom without security, his people exposed once
more to perpetual disorders.... Nay, the whole Christian
world given up to the most cruel discord.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>... Such are
the consequences of a fatal union which God has marked with
his displeasure.... There are also," they added in a lower
tone, "certain things of which his majesty cannot speak in his
letter ... certain incurable disorders under which the
queen suffers, which will never permit the king to look upon her
again as his wife.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> If your holiness puts an end to such wretchedness
by annulling his unlawful marriage, you will attach his
majesty by an indissoluble bond. Assistance, riches, armies,
crown, and even life&mdash;the king our master is ready to employ
all in the service of Rome. He stretches out his hand to you,
most holy father ... stretch out yours to him; by your
union the church will be saved, and Europe will be saved with
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">CLEMENT'S EMBARRASSMENT.</div>

<p>Clement was cruelly embarrassed. His policy consisted in
holding the balance between the two princes, and he was now
called upon to decide in favour of one of them. He began to
regret that he had ever received Henry's ambassadors. "Consider
my position," he said to them, "and entreat the king to
wait until more favourable events leave me at liberty to act."&mdash;"What!"
replied Knight proudly, "has not your holiness promised
to consider his majesty's prayer? If you fail in your promise
now, how can I persuade the king that you will keep it
some future day?"<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Da Casale thought the time had come to
strike a decisive blow. "What evils," he exclaimed, "what
inevitable misfortunes your refusal will create!... The
emperor thinks only of depriving the church of its power, and
the king of England alone has sworn to maintain it." Then
speaking lower, more slowly, and dwelling upon every word, he
continued: "We fear that his majesty, reduced to such extremities
... of the two evils will choose the <i>least</i>,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and supported
by the purity of his intentions, will do <i>of his own authority</i>
... what he now so respectfully demands....
What should we see then?... I shudder at the thought....
Let not your holiness indulge in a false security
which will inevitably drag you into the abyss.... Read
all ... remark all ... divine all ... take
note of all.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>... Most holy father, this is a question of
life and death." And Da Casale's tone said more than his
words.</p>

<p>Clement understood that a positive refusal would expose him
to lose England. Placed between Henry and Charles, as between
the hammer and the forge, he resolved to gain time.
"Well then," he said to Knight and Da Casale, "I will do
what you ask; but I am not familiar with the <i>forms</i> these
dispensations require.... I will consult the Cardinal
<i>Sanctorum Quatuor</i> on the subject ... and then will inform
you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISPENSATION GRANTED.</div>

<p>Knight and Da Casale, wishing to anticipate Clement VII, hastened
to Lorenzo Pucci, cardinal Sanctorum Quatuor, and intimated
to him that their master would know how to be grateful.
The cardinal assured the deputies of his affection for Henry
VIII, and they, in the fulness of their gratitude, laid before
him the four documents which they were anxious to get executed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
But the cardinal had hardly looked at the first&mdash;the
proposal that Wolsey should decide the matter of the divorce
in England&mdash;when he exclaimed: "Impossible! ... a
bull in such terms would cover with eternal disgrace not only
his holiness and the king, but even the cardinal of York himself."
The deputies were confounded, for Wolsey had ordered
them to ask the pope for nothing but his signature.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Recovering
themselves, they rejoined: "All that we require is a <i>competent</i>
commission." On his part, the pope wrote Henry a letter,
in which he managed to say nothing.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>Of the four required documents there were two on whose
immediate despatch Knight and Da Casale insisted: these were
the <i>commission</i> to pronounce the divorce, and the <i>dispensation</i>
to contract a second marriage. The <i>dispensation</i> without the
<i>commission</i> was of no value; this the pope knew well; accordingly
he resolved to give the <i>dispensation</i> only. It was as if
Charles had granted Clement when in prison permission to visit
his cardinals, but denied him liberty to leave the castle of St.
Angelo. It is in such a manner as this that a religious system
transformed into a political system has recourse, when it is
without power, to stratagem. "The <i>commission</i>," said the artful
Medici to Knight, "must be corrected according to the style
of our court; but here is the <i>dispensation</i>." Knight took the
document; it was addressed to Henry VIII and ran thus: "We
accord to you, in case your marriage with Catherine shall be
declared null,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> free liberty to take another wife, provided she
have not been the wife of your brother...." The
Englishman was duped by the Italian. "To my poor judgment,"
he said, "this document will be of use to us." After
this Clement appeared to concern himself solely about Knight's
health, and suddenly manifested the greatest interest for him.
"It is proper that you should hasten your departure," said he,
"for it is necessary that you should travel <i>at your ease</i>. Gambara
will follow you post, and bring the commission." Knight
thus mystified, took leave of the pope, who got rid of Da Casale
and Gambara in a similar manner. He then began to breathe
once more. There was no diplomacy in Europe which Rome,
even in its greatest weakness, could not easily dupe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KNIGHT DUPED BY THE POPE.</div>

<p>It had now become necessary to elude the commission. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the king's envoys were departing in good spirits, reckoning on
the document that was to follow them, the general of the Spanish
Observance reiterated to the pontiff in every tone: "Be careful
to give no document authorising the divorce, and above all, do
not permit this affair to be judged in Henry's states." The
cardinals drew up the document under the influence of De
Angelis, and made it a masterpiece of insignificance. If good
theology ennobles the heart, bad theology, so fertile in
subtleties, imparts to the mind a skill by no means common;
and hence the most celebrated diplomatists have often been
churchmen. The act being thus drawn up, the pope despatched
three copies, to Knight, to Da Casale, and to Gambara.
Knight was near Bologna when the courier overtook him.
He was stupefied, and taking post-horses returned with all
haste to Orvieto.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> Gambara proceeded through France to
England with the useless <i>dispensation</i> which the pope had
granted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE GIVES THE COMMISSION.</div>

<p>Knight had thought to meet with more good faith at the
court of the pope than with kings, and he had been outwitted.
What would Wolsey and Henry say of his folly? His wounded
self-esteem began to make him believe all that Tyndale and
Luther said of the popedom. The former had just published
the <i>Obedience of a Christian Man</i>, and the <i>Parable of the
Wicked Mammon</i>, in which he represented Rome as one of the
transformations of Antichrist. "Antichrist," said he in the latter
treatise, "is not a man that should suddenly appear with wonders;
he is a spiritual thing, who was in the Old Testament, and
also in the time of Christ and the apostles, and is now, and shall
(I doubt not) endure till the world's end. His nature is (when
he is overcome with the Word of God) to go out of the play for
a season, and to disguise himself, and then to come in again
with a new name and new raiment. The Scribes and Pharisees
in the gospel were very Antichrists; popes, cardinals, and bishops
have gotten their new names, but the thing is all one. Even
so now, when we have uttered [detected] him, <i>he will change
himself once more</i>, and turn himself into an angel of light. Already
<i>the beast</i>, seeing himself now to be sought for, roareth and
seeketh new holes to hide himself in, and changeth himself
into a thousand fashions."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> This idea, paradoxical at first,
gradually made its way into men's minds. The Romans, by
their practices, familiarized the English to the somewhat coarse
descriptions of the reformers. England was to have many such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
lessons, and thus by degrees learn to set Rome aside for the sake
of her own glory and prosperity.</p>

<p>Knight and Da Casale reached Orvieto about the same time.
Clement replied with sighs: "Alas! I am the emperor's prisoner.
The imperialists are every day pillaging towns and
castles in our neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>... Wretch that I am! I
have not a friend except the king your master, and he is far
away.... If I should do anything now to displease Charles,
I am a lost man.... To sign the commission would be to
sign an eternal rupture with him." But Knight and Da Casale
pleaded so effectually with Cardinal Sanctorum Quatuor, and so
pressed Clement, that the pontiff, without the knowledge of the
Spaniard De Angelis, gave them a more satisfactory document,
but not such as Wolsey required. "In giving you this commission,"
said the pope, "I am giving away my liberty, and perhaps
my life. I listen not to the voice of prudence, but to that
of affection only. I confide in the generosity of the king of England,
he is the master of my destiny." He then began to weep,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
and seemed ready to faint. Knight, forgetting his vexation,
promised Clement that the king would do everything to save
him.&mdash;"Ah!" said the pope, "there is one effectual means."&mdash;"What
is that?" inquired Henry's agents.&mdash;"M. Lautrec, who
says daily that he will come, but never does," replied Clement,
"has only to bring the French army promptly before the gates
of Orvieto; then I could excuse myself by saying that he constrained
me to sign the commission."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>&mdash;"Nothing is easier,"
replied the envoys, "we will go and hasten his arrival."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY DEMANDS ANOTHER LEGATE.</div>

<p>Clement was not even now at ease. The safety of the Roman
church troubled him not less than his own ... Charles
might discover the trick and make the popedom suffer for it.
There was danger on all sides. If the English spoke of <i>independence</i>,
did not the Emperor threaten a <i>reform</i>?... The
catholic princes, said the papal councillors, are capable, without
perhaps a single exception, of supporting the cause of Luther to
gratify a criminal ambition.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> The pope reflected, and withdrawing
his word, promised to give the commission when Lautrec
was under the walls of Orvieto; but the English agents insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
on having it immediately. To conciliate all, it was agreed that
the pope should give the required document at once, but as soon
as the French army arrived, he should send another copy bearing
the date of the day on which he saw Lautrec. "Beseech the
king to keep secret the commission I give you,"<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> said Clement
VII to Knight; "if he begins the process immediately he receives
it, I am undone forever."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> The pope thus gave permission to act,
on condition of not acting at all. Knight took leave on the 1st of
January 1528; he promised all the pontiff desired, and then, as if
fearing some fresh difficulty, he departed the same day. Da Casale,
on his side, after having offered the Cardinal Sanctorum
Quatuor a gift of 4000 crowns, which he refused, repaired to
Lautrec, to beg him to <i>constrain</i> the pope to sign a document
which was already on its way to England.</p>

<p>But while the business seemed to be clearing at Rome, it was
becoming more complicated in London. The king's project got
wind, and Catherine gave way to the liveliest sorrow. "I shall
protest," said she, "against the commission given to the cardinal
of York. Is he not the king's subject, the vile flatterer of his
pleasures?" Catherine did not resist alone; the people, who
hated the cardinal, could not with pleasure see him invested
with such authority. To obviate this inconvenience, Henry resolved
to ask the pope for another cardinal, who should be empowered
to terminate the affair in London with or without
Wolsey.</p>

<p>The latter agreed to the measure: it is even possible that he
was the first to suggest it, for he feared to bear alone the
responsibility of so hateful an inquiry. Accordingly, on the
27th of December, he wrote to the king's agents at Rome: "Procure
the envoy of a legate, and particularly of an able, easy,
<i>manageable</i> legate ... desirous of meriting the king's favour,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>
Campeggio for instance. You will earnestly request the cardinal
who may be selected, to travel with all diligence, and you will
assure him that the king will behave liberally towards him."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S NEW EXPEDIENT.</div>

<p>Knight reached Asti on the 10th of January, where he found
letters with fresh orders. This was another check: at one time
it is the pope who compels him to retrograde, at another it is
the king. Henry's unlucky valetudinarian secretary, a man
very susceptible of fatigue, and already wearied and exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
by ten painful journeys, was in a very bad humour. He determined
to permit Gambara to carry the two documents to England;
to commission Da Casale, who had not left the pope's
neighbourhood, to solicit the despatch of the legate; and as regarded
himself, to go and wait for further orders at Turin:&mdash;"If
it be thought good unto the king's highness that I do return unto
Orvieto, I shall do as much as <i>my poor carcass</i> may endure."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>When Da Casale reached Bologna, he pressed Lautrec to go
and constrain the pontiff to sign the act which Gambara was already
bearing to England. On receiving the new despatches he
returned in all haste to Orvieto, and the pope was very much
alarmed when he heard of his arrival. He had feared to grant
a simple paper, destined to remain <i>secret</i>; and now he is required
to send a prince of the church! Will Henry never be satisfied?
"The mission you desire would be full of dangers," he replied;
"but we have discovered another means, alone calculated to
finish this business. Mind you do not say that I pointed it out
to you," added the pope in a mysterious tone; "but that it
was suggested by Cardinal Sanctorum Quatuor and Simonetta."
Da Casale was all attention. "There is not a doctor in the
world who can better decide on this matter, and on its most
private circumstances, than the king himself.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> If therefore he
sincerely believes that Catherine had really become his brother's
wife, let him empower the cardinal of York to pronounce the
divorce, and let him take another wife without any further
ceremony;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> he can then afterwards demand the confirmation of
the consistory. The affair being concluded in this way, I will
take the rest upon myself."&mdash;"But," said Da Casale, somewhat
dissatisfied with this new intrigue, "I must fulfil my mission,
and the king demands a legate."&mdash;"And whom shall I send,"
asked Clement. "Da Monte? he cannot move. De Cæsis? he
is at Naples. Ara C&oelig;li? he has the gout. Piccolomini? he is
of the imperial party.... Campeggio would be the best, but
he is at Rome, where he supplies my place, and cannot leave
without peril to the church."... And then with some emotion
he added, "I throw myself into his majesty's arms. The emperor
will never forgive what I am doing. If he hears of it he
will summon me before <i>his council</i>; I shall have no rest until he
has deprived me of my throne and my life."<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p>Da Casale hastened to forward to London the result of the conference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Clement being unable to untie the knot, requested
Henry to cut it. Will this prince hesitate to employ so easy a
means, the pope (Clement declared it himself) being willing to
ratify everything?</p>

<p>Here closes Henry's first campaign in the territories of the
popedom. We shall now see the results of so many efforts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISAPPOINTMENT IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Never was disappointment more complete than that felt by
Henry and Wolsey after the arrival of Gambara with the commission;
the king was angry, the cardinal vexed. What Clement
called the <i>sacrifice of his life</i> was in reality but a sheet of
paper fit only to be thrown into the fire. "This commission is
of no value,"<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> said Wolsey.&mdash;"And even to put it into execution,"
added Henry, "we must wait until the imperialists have
quitted Italy! The pope is putting us off to the Greek calends."&mdash;"His
holiness," observed the cardinal, "does not bind himself
to pronounce the divorce; the queen will therefore appeal from
our judgment."&mdash;"And even if the pope had bound himself,"
added the king, "it would be sufficient for the emperor to smile
upon him, to make him retract what he had promised."&mdash;"It
is all a cheat and a mockery," concluded both king and
minister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR DECLARED AGAINST CHARLES.</div>

<p>What was to be done next? The only way to make Clement
ours, thought Wolsey, is to get rid of Charles; it is time
his pride was brought down. Accordingly, on the 21st of
January 1528, France and England declared hostilities against
the emperor. When Charles heard of this proceeding he exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
"I know the hand that has flung the torch of war into
the midst of Europe. My crime is not having placed the cardinal
of York on St. Peter's throne."</p>

<p>A mere declaration of war was not enough for Wolsey; the
bishop of Bayonne, ambassador from France, seeing him one
day somewhat excited,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> whispered in his ear: "In former times
popes have deposed emperors for smaller offences." Charles's
deposition would have delivered the king of France from a
troublesome rival; but Du Bellay, fearing to take the initiative in
so bold an enterprise, suggested the idea to the cardinal. Wolsey
reflected: such a thought had never before occurred to him.
Taking the ambassador aside to a window, he there swore
<i>stoutly</i>, said Du Bellay, that he should be delighted to use all
his influence to get Charles deposed by the pope. "No one is
more likely than yourself," replied the bishop, "to induce
Clement to do it."&mdash;"I will use all my credit," rejoined
Wolsey, and the two priests separated. This bright idea the
cardinal never forgot. Charles had robbed him of the tiara;
he will retaliate by depriving Charles of his crown. <i>An
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</i> Staffileo, dean of the
Rota, was then in London, and still burning with resentment
against the author of the Sack of Rome, he favourably received
the suggestions Wolsey made to him; and, finally, the envoy
from John Zapolya, king-elect of Hungary, supported the project.
But the kings of France and England were not so easily
induced to put the thrones of kings at the disposal of the priests.
It appears, however, that the pope was sounded on the subject;
and if the emperor had been beaten in Italy, it is probable that
the bull would have been fulminated against him. His sword
preserved his crown, and the plot of the two bishops failed.</p>

<p>The king's councillors began to seek for less heroic means.
"We must prosecute the affair at <i>Rome</i>," said some.&mdash;"No,"
said others, "in <i>England</i>. The pope is too much afraid of the
emperor to pronounce the divorce in person."&mdash;"If the pope
fears the emperor more than the king of England," exclaimed
the proud Tudor, "we shall find some other way to set him at
ease."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Thus, at the first contradiction, Henry placed his hand
on his sword, and threatened to sever the ties which bound his
kingdom to the throne of the Italian pontiff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S NEW PROJECT.</div>

<p>"I have hit it!" said Wolsey at length; "we must combine
the two clans&mdash;judge the affair in London, and at the same time
bind the Pontiff at Rome." And then the able cardinal proposed
the draft of a bull, by which the pope, delegating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
authority to two legates, should declare that the acts of that
delegation should have a perpetual effect, notwithstanding any
contrary decrees that might subsequently emanate from his infallible
authority.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> A new mission was decided upon for the
accomplishment of this bold design.</p>

<p>Wolsey, annoyed by the folly of Knight and his colleagues,
desired men of another stamp. He therefore cast his eyes on
his own secretary, Stephen Gardiner, an active man, intelligent,
supple, and crafty, a learned canonist, desirous of the king's
favour, and, above all, a good Romanist, which at Rome was not
without its advantage. Gardiner was in small the living image
of his master; and hence the cardinal sometimes styled him
<i>the half of himself</i>.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Edward Fox, the chief almoner, was joined
with him&mdash;a moderate, influential man, a particular friend of
Henry's, and a zealous advocate of the divorce. Fox was named
first in the commission; but it was agreed that Gardiner should
be the real head of the embassy. "Repeat without ceasing,"
Wolsey told them, "that his majesty cannot do otherwise than
separate from the queen. Attack each one on his weak side.
Declare to the pope that the king promises to defend him
against the emperor; and to the cardinals that their services
will be nobly rewarded.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> If that does not suffice, let the energy
of your words be such as to excite a wholesome fear in the
pontiff."</p>

<p>Fox and Gardiner, after a gracious reception at Paris (23rd
February), by Francis I, arrived at Orvieto on the 20th of
March, after many perils, and with their dress in such disorder,
that no one could have taken them for the ambassadors of
Henry VIII. "What a city!" they exclaimed, as they passed
through its streets; "what ruins, what misery! It is indeed
truly called Orvieto (<i>urbs vetus</i>)!" The state of the town gave
them no very grand idea of the state of the popedom, and they
imagined that with a pontiff so poorly lodged, their negotiation
could not be otherwise than easy. "I give you my house," said
Da Casale, to whom they went, "my room and my own bed;"
and as they made some objections, he added: "It is not possible
to lodge you elsewhere; I have even been forced to borrow what
was necessary to receive you."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Da Casale, pressing them to
change their clothes, which were still dripping (they had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
crossed a river on their mules), they replied, that being obliged
to travel post, they had not been able to bring a change of raiment.
"Alas!" said Casale, "what is to be done? there are few
persons in Orvieto who have more garments than one;<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> even the
shopkeepers have no cloth for sale; this town is quite a prison.
People say the pope is at liberty here. A pretty liberty indeed!
Want, impure air, wretched lodging, and a thousand other inconveniences
keep the holy father closer than when he was in
the Castle of St. Angelo. Accordingly, he told me the other
day, it was better to be in captivity at Rome than at liberty
here."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE.</div>

<p>In two days, however, they managed to procure some new
clothing; and being now in a condition to show themselves,
Henry's agents were admitted to an after-dinner audience on
Monday the 22nd of March (1528).</p>

<p>Da Casale conducted them to an old building in ruins. "This
is where his holiness lives," he said. They looked at one another
with astonishment, and crossing the rubbish lying about, passed
through three chambers whose ceilings had fallen in, whose windows
were curtainless, and in which thirty persons "<i>riff-raff</i>
were standing against the bare walls for a garnishment."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> This
was the pope's court.</p>

<p>At length the ambassadors reached the pontiff's room, and
placed Henry's letters in his hands. "Your holiness," said
Gardiner, "when sending the king a dispensation, was pleased
to add, that if this document were not sufficient, you would
willingly give a better. It is that favour the king now desires."
The pope with embarrassment strove to soften his refusal. "I
am informed," he said, "that the king is led on in this affair by a
secret inclination, and that the lady he loves is far from being
worthy of him." Gardiner replied with firmness: "The king
truly deserves to marry again after the divorce, that he may
have an heir to the crown; but the woman he proposes to take
is animated by the noblest sentiments; the cardinal of York and
all England do homage to her virtues."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> The pope appeared
convinced. "Besides," continued Gardiner, "the king has written
a book on the motives of his divorce."&mdash;"Good! come and
read it to me to-morrow," rejoined Clement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECOND AUDIENCE.</div>

<p>The next day the English envoys had hardly appeared, before
Clement took Henry's book, ran over it as he walked up and down
the room, and then seating himself on a long bench covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
with an old carpet, "not worth twenty pence," says an annalist,
he read the book aloud. He counted the number of arguments,
made objections as if Henry were present, and piled them
one upon another without waiting for an answer. "The marriages
forbidden in Leviticus," said he, in a short and quick tone
of voice, "are permitted in Deuteronomy; now Deuteronomy
coming after Leviticus, we are bound by the latter. The honour
of Catherine and the emperor is at stake, and the divorce
would give rise to a terrible war."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> The pope continued
speaking, and whenever the Englishmen attempted to reply, he
bade them be silent, and kept on reading. "It is an excellent
book," said he, however, in a courteous tone, when he had ended;
"I shall keep it to read over again at my leisure." Gardiner
then presenting a draft of the commission which Henry required,
Clement made answer: "It is too late to look at it now;
leave it with me."&mdash;"But we are in haste," added Gardiner.&mdash;"Yes,
yes, I know it," said the pope. All his efforts tended to
protract the business.</p>

<p>On the 28th of March, the ambassadors were conducted to
the room in which the pope slept; the cardinals Sanctorum
Quatuor and De Monte, as well as the councillor of the Rota,
Simonetta, were then with him. Chairs were arranged in a
semicircle. "Be seated," said Clement, who stood in the middle.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
"Master Gardiner, now tell me what you want."&mdash;"There
is no question between us but one of <i>time</i>. You promised
to ratify the divorce, as soon as it was pronounced; and
we require you to do <i>before</i> what you engage to do <i>after</i>. What
is right on one day, must be right on another." Then, raising
his voice, the Englishman added: "If his majesty perceives that
no more respect is paid to him than to a common man,<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> he
will have recourse to a <i>remedy</i> which I will not name, but which
will not fail in its effect."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TEMPORIZER.</div>

<p>The pope and his councillors looked at one another in silence;<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
they had understood him. The imperious Gardiner, remarking
the effect which he had produced, then added in an absolute
tone: "We have our instructions, and are determined to keep
to them."&mdash;"I am ready to do everything compatible with my
honour," exclaimed Clement, in alarm.&mdash;"What your honour
would not permit you to grant," said the proud ambassador,
"the honour of the king, my master, would not permit him to
ask." Gardiner's language became more imperative every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
minute. "Well, then," said Clement, driven to extremity, "I
will do what the king demands, and if the emperor is angry, I
cannot help it." The interview, which had commenced with a
storm, finished with a gleam of sunshine.</p>

<p>That bright gleam soon disappeared: Clement, who imagined he
saw in Henry a Hannibal at war with Rome, wished to play the
temporizer, the <i>Fabius Cunctator</i>. "<i>Bis dat qui cito dat</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> said
Gardiner sharply, who observed this man&oelig;uvre.&mdash;"It is a question
of law," replied the pope, "and as I am very ignorant in
these matters, I must give the doctors of the canon law the
necessary time to make it all clear."&mdash;"By his delays Fabius
Maximus saved Rome," rejoined Gardiner; "you will destroy it
by yours."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>&mdash;"Alas!" exclaimed the pope, "if I say the king
is right, I shall have to go back to prison."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>&mdash;"When truth is
concerned," said the ambassador, "of what consequence are the
opinions of men?" Gardiner was speaking at his ease, but Clement
found that the castle of St. Angelo was not without
weight in the balance. "You may be sure that I shall do
everything for the best," replied the modern Fabius. With
these words the conference terminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE WITHOUT THE KEY.</div>

<p>Such were the struggles of England with the popedom&mdash;struggles
which were to end in a definitive rupture. Gardiner
knew that he had a skilful adversary to deal with; too
cunning to allow himself to be irritated, he coolly resolved
to frighten the pontiff: that was in his instructions. On
the Friday before Palm Sunday, he was ushered into the
pope's closet; there he found Clement attended by De Monte,
Sanctorum Quatuor, Simonetta, Staffileo, Paul, auditor of the
Rota, and Gambara. "It is impossible," said the cardinals,
"to grant a decretal commission in which the pope pronounces
<i>de jure</i> in favour of the divorce, with a promise of confirmation
<i>de facto</i>." Gardiner insisted; but no persuasion, "neither dulce
nor poynante,"<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> could move the pontiff. The envoy judged the
moment had come to discharge his strongest battery. "O perverse
race," said he to the pontiff's ministers, "instead of being
harmless as doves, you are as full of dissimulation and malice as
serpents; promising everything but performing nothing.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> England
will be driven to believe that God has taken from you the
key of knowledge, and that the laws of the popes, ambiguous to
the popes themselves, are only fit to be cast into the fire.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
king has hitherto restrained his people, impatient of the Romish
yoke; but he will now give them the rein." A long and gloomy
silence followed. Then the Englishman, suddenly changing his
tone, softly approached Clement, who had left his seat, and conjured
him in a low voice to consider carefully what justice required
of him. "Alas!" replied Clement, "I tell you again, I
am ignorant in these matters. According to the maxims of the
canon law <i>the pope carries all laws in the tablets of his heart</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
but unfortunately God has never given me <i>the key</i> that opens
them." As he could not escape by silence, Clement retreated
under cover of a jest, and heedlessly pronounced the condemnation
of the popedom. If he had never received the famous <i>key</i>,
there was no reason why other pontiffs should have possessed it.
The next day he found another loophole; for when the ambassadors
told him that the king would carry on the matter without
him, he sighed, drew out his handkerchief, and said as he
wiped his eyes:<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> "Would to God that I were dead!" Clement
employed tears as a political engine.</p>

<p>"We shall not get the <i>decretal</i> commission," (that which pronounced
the divorce) said Fox and Gardiner after this, "and it
is not really necessary. Let us demand the <i>general</i> commission
(authorizing the legates to pronounce it), and exact a promise
that shall supply the place of the act which is denied us." Clement,
who was ready to make all the promises in the world,
swore to ratify the sentence of the legates without delay. Fox
and Gardiner then presented to Simonetta a draft of the act
required. The dean, after reading it, returned it to the envoys,
saying, "It is very well, I think, except <i>the end</i>;<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> show it Sanctorum
Quatuor." The next morning they carried the draft to
that cardinal: "How long has it been the rule for the patient
to write the prescription? I always thought it was the physician's
business."&mdash;"No one knows the disease so well as the patient,"
replied Gardiner; "and this disease may be of such a
nature that the doctor cannot prescribe the remedy without
taking the patient's advice." Sanctorum Quatuor read the prescription,
and then returned it, saying: "It is not bad, with the
exception of <i>the beginning</i>.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Take the draft to De Monte and
the other councillors." The latter liked neither beginning, middle,
nor end. "We will send for you this evening," said De
Monte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW TRAGEDY.</div>

<p>Three or four days having elapsed, Henry's envoys again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
waited on the pope, who showed them the draft prepared by his
councillors. Gardiner remarking in it additions, retrenchments,
and corrections, threw it disdainfully from him, and said coldly:
"Your holiness is deceiving us; you have selected these men to
be the instruments of your duplicity." Clement, in alarm, sent
for Simonetta; and after a warm discussion,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> the envoys, more
discontented than ever, quitted the pope at one in the morning.</p>

<p>The night brings wisdom. "I only desire two little words
more in the commission," said Gardiner next day to Clement
and Simonetta. The pope requested Simonetta to wait upon
the cardinals immediately; the latter sent word that they were
at dinner, and adjourned the business until the morrow.</p>

<p>When Gardiner heard of this Epicurean message, he thought
the time had come for striking a decisive blow. A new tragedy
began.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> "We are deceived," exclaimed he, "you are laughing
at us. This is not the way to gain the favour of princes. Water
mixed with wine spoils it;<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> your corrections nullify our document.
These ignorant and suspicious priests have spelled over
our draft as if a scorpion was hidden under every word.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>&mdash;You
made us come to Italy," said he to Staffileo and Gambara, "like
hawks which the fowler lures by holding out to them a piece of
meat;<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> and now that we are here, the bait has disappeared, and,
instead of giving us what we sought, you pretend to lull us to
sleep by the sweet voice of the sirens."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Then, turning to
Clement, the English envoy added, "Your holiness will have to
answer for this." The pope sighed and wiped away his tears.
"It was God's pleasure," continued Gardiner, whose tone became
more threatening every minute, "that we should see with
our own eyes the disposition of the people here. It is time to have
done. Henry is not an ordinary prince,&mdash;bear in mind that you
are insulting <i>the defender of the faith</i>.... You are going
to lose the favour of the only monarch who protects you, and
the apostolical chair, already tottering, will fall into dust, and
disappear entirely amidst the applause of all Christendom."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S TERROR.</div>

<p>Gardiner paused. The pope was moved. The state of Italy
seemed to confirm but too strongly the sinister predictions of
the envoy of Henry VIII. The imperial troops, terrified and
pursued by Lautrec, had abandoned Rome and retired on Naples.
The French general was following up this wretched army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of Charles V, decimated by pestilence and debauchery; Doria,
at the head of his galleys, had destroyed the Spanish fleet; Gaeta
and Naples only were left to the imperialists; and Lautrec, who
was besieging the latter place, wrote to Henry on the 26th of
August that all would soon be over. The timid Clement VII
had attentively watched all these catastrophes. Accordingly,
Gardiner had hardly denounced the danger which threatened
the popedom, before he turned pale with affright, rose from his
seat, stretched out his arms in terror, as if he had desired to
repel some monster ready to devour him, and exclaimed, "Write,
write! Insert whatever words you please." As he said this,
he paced up and down the room, raising his hands to heaven
and sighing deeply, while Fox and Gardiner, standing motionless,
looked on in silence. A tempestuous wind seemed to be stirring
the depths of the abyss; the ambassadors waited until the storm
was abated. At last Clement recovered himself,<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> made a few
trivial excuses, and dismissed Henry's ministers. It was an
hour past midnight.</p>

<p>It was neither morality, nor religion, nor even the laws of
the church which led Clement to refuse the divorce; ambition
and fear were his only motives. He would have desired that
Henry should first constrain the emperor to restore him his territories.
But the king of England, who felt himself unable to
protect the pope against Charles, required, however, this unhappy
pontiff to provoke the emperor's anger. Clement reaped
the fruits of that fatal system which had transformed the
church of Jesus Christ into a pitiful combination of policy and
cunning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGAGEMENT CONCEDED.</div>

<p>On the next day, the tempest having thoroughly abated,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
Sanctorum Quatuor corrected the commission. It was signed,
completed by a leaden seal attached to a piece of string, and
then handed to Gardiner, who read it. The bull was addressed
to Wolsey, and "authorized him, in case he should acknowledge
the nullity of Henry's marriage, to pronounce judicially the sentence
of divorce, but without noise or display of judgment;<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> for
that purpose he might take any English bishop for his colleague."&mdash;"All
that we can do, you can do," said the pope.
"We are very doubtful," said the importunate Gardiner after
reading the bull, "whether this commission, without the clauses
of <i>confirmation</i> and <i>revocation</i>, will satisfy his majesty; but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
will do all in our power to get him to accept it."&mdash;"Above all,
do not speak of our altercations," said the pope. Gardiner, like
a discreet diplomist, did not scruple to note down every particular
in cipher in the letters whence these details are procured.
"Tell the king," continued the pontiff, "that this commission
is on my part a declaration of war against the emperor, and
that I now place myself under his majesty's protection." The
chief-almoner of England departed for London with the precious
document.</p>

<p>But one storm followed close upon another. Fox had not
long quitted Orvieto when new letters arrived from Wolsey,
demanding the fourth of the acts previously requested, namely,
the <i>engagement</i> to ratify at Rome whatever the commissioners
might decide in England. Gardiner was to set about it <i>in season
and out of season</i>; the verbal promise of the pope counted
for nothing; this document must be had, whether the pope was
ill, dying, or dead.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> "<i>Ego et Rex meus</i>, his majesty and I command
you;" said Wolsey; "this divorce is of more consequence
to us than twenty popedoms."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> The English envoy renewed
their demand. "Since you refuse the decretal," he said, "there
is the greater reason why you should not refuse <i>the engagement</i>."
This application led to fresh discussion and fresh tears. Clement
gave way once more; but the Italians, more crafty than
Gardiner, reserved a loophole in the document through which
the pontiff might escape. The messenger Thaddeus carried it
to London; and Gardiner left Orvieto for Rome to confer with
Campeggio.</p>

<p>Clement was a man of penetrating mind, and although he
knew as well as any how to deliver a clever speech, he was
irresolute and timid; and accordingly the commission had not
long been despatched before he repented. Full of distress, he
paced the ruined chambers of his old palace, and imagined he
saw hanging over his head that terrible sword of Charles the
Fifth, whose edge he had already felt. "Wretch that I am,"
said he, "cruel wolves surround me; they open their jaws to swallow
me up.... I see none but enemies around me. At
their head is the emperor.... What will he do? Alas!
I have yielded that fatal commission which the general of the
Spanish observance had enjoined me to refuse. Behind Charles
come the Venetians, the Florentines, the duke of Ferrara....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
They have cast lots upon my vesture.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>... Next comes
the king of France, who promises nothing, but looks on with
folded arms; or rather, what perfidy! calls upon me at this critical
moment to deprive Charles V of his crown.... And
last, but not least, Henry VIII, <i>the defender of the faith</i>, indulges
in frightful menaces against me.... The emperor desires
to maintain the queen on the throne of England; the latter, to
put her away.... Would to God that Catherine were in
her grave! But, alas! she lives ... to be the apple of
discord dividing the two greatest monarchies, and the inevitable
cause of the ruin of the popedom.... Wretched man that
I am! how cruel is my perplexity, and around me, I can see nothing
but horrible confusion."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX'S REPORT TO HENRY AND ANNE.</div>

<p>During this time Fox was making his way to England. On
the 27th of April he reached Paris; on the 2nd of May he landed
at Sandwich, and hastened to Greenwich, where he arrived the
next day at five in the evening, just as Wolsey had left for
London. Fox's arrival was an event of great importance.
"Let him go to Lady Anne's apartments," said the king, "and
wait for me there." Fox told Anne Boleyn of his and Gardiner's
exertions, and the success of their mission, at which she
expressed her very great satisfaction. Indeed, more than a
year had elapsed since her return to England, and she no longer
resisted Henry's project. "Mistress Anne always called me
Master Stephen," wrote Fox to Gardiner, "her thoughts were so
full of you." The king appeared and Anne withdrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX REPORTS TO THE KING.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>"Tell me as briefly as possible what you have done," said
Henry. Fox placed in the king's hands the pope's insignificant
letter, which he bade his almoner read; then that from Staffileo,
which was put on one side; and lastly Gardiner's letter, which
Henry took hastily and read himself. "The pope has promised
us," said Fox, as he terminated his report, "to confirm the sentence
of the divorce, as soon as it has been pronounced by the
commissioners."&mdash;"Excellent!" exclaimed Henry; and then he
ordered Anne to be called in. "Repeat before this lady," he
said to Fox, "what you have just told me." The almoner did
so. "The pope is convinced of the justice of your cause," he
said in conclusion, "and the cardinal's letter has convinced him
that my lady is worthy of the throne of England."&mdash;"Make
your report to Wolsey this very night," said the king.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock when the chief almoner reached the cardinal's
palace; he had gone to bed, but immediate orders were
given that Fox should be conducted to his room. Being a
churchman, Wolsey could understand the pope's artifices better
than Henry; accordingly, as soon as he learnt that Fox had
brought the commission only, he became alarmed at the task
imposed upon him. "What a misfortune!" he exclaimed; "your
commission is no better than Gambara's.... However,
go and rest yourself; I will examine these papers to-morrow."
Fox withdrew in confusion. "It is not bad," said Wolsey the
next day, "but the whole business still falls on me alone!&mdash;Never
mind, I must wear a contented look, or else...."
In the afternoon he summoned into his closet Fox, Dr. Bell,
and Viscount Rochford: "Master Gardiner has surpassed himself,"
said the crafty supple cardinal; "What a man! what an
inestimable treasure! what a jewel in our kingdom!"<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S FRAUD.</div>

<p>He did not mean a word he was saying. Wolsey was dissatisfied
with every thing,&mdash;with the refusal of the <i>decretal</i>, and
with the drawing up of the <i>commission</i>, as well as of the <i>engagement</i>
(which arrived soon after in good condition, so far as the
outside was concerned). But the king's ill humour would infallibly
recoil on Wolsey; so putting a good face on a bad matter,
he ruminated in secret on the means of obtaining what had
been refused him. "Write to Gardiner," said he to Fox, "that
every thing makes me desire the pope's <i>decretal</i>&mdash;the need of
unburdening my conscience, of being able to reply to the calumniators
who will attack my judgment,<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> and the thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
accidents to which the life of man is exposed. Let his holiness,
then, pronounce the divorce himself; we engage on our part to
keep his resolution secret. But order Master Stephen to employ
every kind of persuasion that his <i>rhetoric</i> can imagine."
In case the pope should positively refuse the decretal, Wolsey
required that at least Campeggio should share the responsibility
of the divorce with him.</p>

<p>This was not all: while reading the engagement, Wolsey discovered
the loophole which had escaped Gardiner, and this is
what he contrived:&mdash;"The <i>engagement</i> which the pope has sent
us," he wrote to Gardiner, "is drawn up in such terms that he
can retract it at pleasure; we must therefore find some <i>good
way</i> to obtain another. You may do it under this pretence.
You will appear before his holiness with a dejected air, and tell
him that the courier, to whom the conveyance of the said engagement
was intrusted, fell into the water with his despatches,
so that the rescripts were totally defaced and illegible; that I
have not dared deliver it into the king's hands, and unless his
holiness will grant you a duplicate, some notable blame will be
imputed unto you for not taking better care in its transmission.
And further, you will continue: I remember the expressions of
the former document, and to save your holiness trouble, I will
dictate them to your secretary. Then," added Wolsey, "while
the secretary is writing, you will find means to introduce, without
its being perceived, as many <i>fat</i>, <i>pregnant</i>, and available
words as possible, to bind the pope and enlarge my powers, the
politic handling of which the king's highness and I commit unto
your good discretion."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>Such was the expedient invented by Wolsey. The papal
secretary, imagining he was making a fresh copy of the original
document (which was, by the way, in perfect condition), was at
the dictation of the ambassador to draw up another of a different
tenor. The "politic handling" of the cardinal-legate, which
was not very unlike forgery, throws a disgraceful light on the
policy of the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S HYPOCRISY.</div>

<p>Wolsey read this letter to the chief-almoner; and then, to set
his conscience at rest, he added piously: "In an affair of such
high importance, on which depends the glory or the ruin of the
realm,&mdash;my honour or my disgrace&mdash;the condemnation of my
soul or my everlasting merit&mdash;I will listen solely to the voice of
my conscience,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> and I shall act in such a manner as to be able
to render an account to God without fear."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<p>Wolsey did more; it seems that the boldness of his declarations
reassured him with regard to the baseness of his works.
Being at Greenwich on the following Sunday, he said to the
king in the presence of Fox, Bell, Wolman, and Tuke: "I am
bound to your royal person more than any subject was ever
bound to his prince. I am ready to sacrifice my goods, my
blood, my life for you.... But my obligations towards
God are greater still. For that cause, rather than act against
his will, I would endure the extremest evils.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> I would suffer
your royal indignation, and, if necessary, deliver my body to the
executioners that they might cut it in pieces." What could be
the spirit then impelling Wolsey? Was it blindness or impudence?
He may have been sincere in the words he addressed
to Henry; at the bottom of his heart he may have desired to
set the pope above the king, and the church of Rome above the
kingdom of England; and this desire may have appeared to him
a sublime virtue, such as would hide a multitude of sins. What
the public conscience would have called treason, was heroism to
the Romish priest. This zeal for the papacy is sometimes met
with in conjunction with the most flagrant immorality. If
Wolsey deceived the pope, it was to save popery in the realm of
England. Fox, Bell, Wolman, and Tuke listened to him with
astonishment.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Henry, who thought he knew his man, received
these holy declarations without alarm, and the cardinal having
thus eased his conscience, proceeded boldly to his iniquities. It
seems, however, that the inward reproaches which he silenced in
public, had their revenge in secret. One of his officers entering
his closet shortly afterwards, presented a letter addressed to
Campeggio for his signature. It ended thus: "I hope all things
shall be done according to the will of God, the desire of the
king, the quiet of the kingdom, and to our honour <i>with a good
conscience</i>." The cardinal having read the letter, dashed out
the four last words.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> Conscience has a sting from which none
can escape, not even a Wolsey.</p>

<p>However, Gardiner lost no time in Italy. When he met
Campeggio (to whom Henry VIII had given a palace at Rome,
and a bishopric in England), he entreated him to go to London
and pronounce the divorce. This prelate, who was to be empowered
in 1530 with authority to crush Protestantism in Germany,
seemed bound to undertake a mission that would save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Romanism in Britain. But proud of his position at Rome,
where he acted as the pope's representative, he cared not for a
charge that would undoubtedly draw upon him either Henry's
hatred or the emperor's anger. He begged to be excused. The
pope spoke in a similar tone. When he was informed of this,
the terrible Tudor, beginning to believe that Clement desired to
entangle him, as the hunter entangles the lion in his toils, gave
vent to his anger on Tuke, Fox, and Gardiner, but particularly
on Wolsey. Nor were reasons wanting for this explosion. The
cardinal, perceiving that his hatred against Charles had carried
him too far, pretended that it was without his orders that
Clarencieux, bribed by France, had combined with the French
ambassador to declare war against the emperor; and added that
he would have the English king-at-arms put to death as he
passed through Calais. This was an infallible means of preventing
disagreeable revelations. But the herald, who had been
forewarned, crossed by way of Boulogne, and, without the cardinal's
knowledge, obtained an interview with Henry, before
whom he placed the <i>orders</i> he had received from Wolsey in <i>three</i>
consecutive letters. The king, astonished at his minister's impudence,
exclaimed profanely: "O Lord Jesu, the man in whom
I had most confidence told me quite the contrary." He then
summoned Wolsey before him, and reproached him severely for
his falsehoods. The wretched man shook like a leaf. Henry
appeared to pardon him, but the season of his favour had passed
away. Henceforward he kept the cardinal as one of those instruments
we make use of for a time, and then throw away
when we have no further need of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HE BEGINS TO TREMBLE.</div>

<p>The king's anger against the pope far exceeded that against
Wolsey; he trembled from head to foot, rose from his seat, then
sat down again, and vented his wrath in the most violent language:&mdash;"What!"
he exclaimed, "I shall exhaust my political
combinations, empty my treasury, make war upon my friends,
consume my forces ... and for whom?... for a
heartless priest who, considering neither the exigencies of my
honour, nor the peace of my conscience, nor the prosperity of
my kingdom, nor the numerous benefits which I have lavished
on him, refuses me a favour, which he ought, as the common
father of the faithful, to grant even to an enemy....
Hypocrite!... You cover yourself with the cloak of
friendship, you flatter us by crafty practices,<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> but you give us
only a bastard document, and you say like Pilate: It matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
little to me if this king perishes, and all his kingdom with him;

understand you ... you wish to entangle us in the briers,<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
to catch us in a trap, to lure us into a pitfall.... But
we have discovered the snare; we shall escape from your ambuscade,
and brave your power."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR T. MORE'S PROPHECY.</div>

<p>Such was the language then heard at the court of England,
says an historian.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> The monks and priests began to grow
alarmed, while the most enlightened minds already saw in the
distance the first gleams of religious liberty. One day, at a
time when Henry was proving himself a zealous follower of the
Romish doctrines, Sir Thomas More was sitting in the midst of
his family, when his son-in-law, Roper, now become a warm
papist, exclaimed: "Happy kingdom of England, where no
heretic dares show his face!"&mdash;"That is true, son Roper," said
More; "we seem to sit now upon the mountains, treading the
heretics under our feet like ants; but I pray God that some of
us do not live to see the day when we gladly would wish to be
at league with them, to suffer them to have their churches
quietly to themselves, so that they would be content to let us
have ours peaceably to ourselves." Roper angrily replied:<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> "By
my word, sir, that is very desperately spoken!" More, however,
was in the right; genius is sometimes a great diviner. The
Reformation was on the point of inaugurating religious liberty,
and by that means placing civil liberty on an immovable foundation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMANISM AND CONSCIENCE.</div>

<p>Henry himself grew wiser by degrees. He began to have
doubts about the Roman hierarchy, and to ask himself, whether
a priest-king, embarrassed in all the political complications of
Europe, could be the head of the church of Jesus Christ. Pious
individuals in his kingdom recognized in Scripture and in conscience
a law superior to the law of Rome, and refused to sacrifice
at the command of the church their moral convictions,
sanctioned by the revelation of God. The hierarchical system,
which claims to absorb man in the papacy, had oppressed the
consciences of Christians for centuries. When the Romish
Church had required from such as Berengarius, John Huss,
Savonarola, John Wesel, and Luther, the denial of their
consciences enlightened by the word, that is to say, by the voice
of God, it had shown most clearly how great is the immorality
of ultramontane socialism. "If the Christian consents to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
enormous demand of the hierarchy," said the most enlightened
men; "if he renounces his own notions of good and evil in favour
of the clergy; if he reserves not his right to obey God, who
speaks to him in the Bible, rather than men, even if their
agreement were universal; if Henry VIII, for instance, should
silence his conscience, which condemns his union with his
brother's widow, to obey the clerical voice which approves of it;
by that very act he renounces truth, duty, and even God himself."
But we must add, that if the rights of conscience were
beginning to be understood in England, it was not about such
holy matters as these that the pope and Henry were contending.
They were both intriguers&mdash;both dissatisfied, the one desirous
of love, the other of power.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, a feeling of disgust for Rome then took
root in the king's heart, and nothing could afterwards eradicate
it. He immediately made every exertion to attract Erasmus
to London. Indeed, if Henry separated from the pope, his old
friends, the humanists, must be his auxiliaries, and not the
heretical doctors. But Erasmus, in a letter dated 1st June,
alleged the weak state of his health, the robbers who infested
the roads, the wars and rumours of wars then afloat. "Our
destiny leads us," he said; "let us yield to it."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> It is a
fortunate thing for England that Erasmus was not its reformer.</p>

<p>Wolsey noted this movement of his master's, and resolved to
make a strenuous effort to reconcile Clement and Henry; his
own safety was at stake. He wrote to the pope, to Campeggio,
to Da Casale, to all Italy. He declared that if he was ruined,
the popedom would be ruined too, so far at least as England
was concerned: "I would obtain the <i>decretal</i> bull with my own
blood, if possible,"<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> he added. "Assure the holy father on my
life that no mortal eye shall see it." Finally, he ordered the
chief-almoner to write to Gardiner: "If Campeggio does not
come, <i>you shall never return</i> to England;"<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> an infallible means
of stimulating the secretary's zeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT GRANTS ALL THE BULLS.</div>

<p>This was the last effort of Henry VIII. Bourbon and the
Prince of Orange had not employed more zeal a year before in
scaling the walls of Rome. Wolsey's fire had inflamed his
agents; they argued, entreated, stormed, and threatened. The
alarmed cardinals and theologians, assembling at the pope's call,
discussed the matter, mixing political interests with the affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of the church.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> At last they understood what Wolsey now
communicated to them. "Henry is the most energetic defender
of the faith," they said. "It is only by acceding to his demand
that we can preserve the kingdom of England to the
popedom. The army of Charles is in full flight, and that of
Francis triumphs." The last of these arguments decided the
question; the pope suddenly felt a great sympathy for Wolsey
and for the English Church; the emperor was beaten; therefore
he was wrong. Clement granted everything.</p>

<p>First, Campeggio was desired to go to London. The pontiff
knew that he might reckon on his intelligence and inflexible
adhesion to the interests of the hierarchy; even the cardinal's
gout was of use, for it might help to innumerable delays. Next,
on the 8th of June, the pope, then at Viterbo, gave a new
commission, by which he conferred on Wolsey and Campeggio
the power to declare null and void the marriage between Henry
and Catherine, with liberty for the king and queen to form new
matrimonial ties.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> A few days later he signed the famous <i>decretal</i>
by which he himself annulled the marriage between Henry and
Catherine; but instead of intrusting it to Gardiner, he gave
it to Campeggio, with orders not to let it go out of his hands.
Clement was not sure of the course of events: if Charles
should decidedly lose his power, the bull would be published
in the face of Christendom; if he should recover it, the bull
would be burnt.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> In fact the flames did actually consume some
time afterwards this decree which Clement had wetted with his
tears as he put his name to it. Finally, on the 23rd of July,
the pope signed a valid <i>engagement</i>, by which he declared beforehand
that all retractation of these acts should be <i>null and
void</i>.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Campeggio and Gardiner departed. Charles's defeat
was as complete at Rome as at Naples; the justice of his cause
had vanished with his army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Nothing, therefore, was wanting to Henry's desires. He had
Campeggio, the commission, the decretal bull of divorce signed
by the pope, and the engagement giving an irrevocable value to
all these acts. Wolsey was conqueror,&mdash;the conqueror of Clement!...
He had often wished to mount the restive courser
of the popedom and to guide it at his will, but each time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the unruly steed had thrown him from the saddle. Now he
was firm in his seat, and held the horse in hand. Thanks to
Charles's reverses, he was master at Rome. The popedom,
whether it was pleased or not, must take the road he had
chosen, and before which it had so long recoiled. The king's
joy was unbounded, and equalled only by Wolsey's. The cardinal,
in the fulness of his heart, wishing to show his gratitude
to the officers of the Roman court, made them presents of
carpets, horses, and vessels of gold.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> All near Henry felt the
effects of his good humour. Anne smiled; the court indulged
in amusements; the <i>great affair</i> was about to be accomplished;
the New Testament to be delivered to the flames. The union
between England and the popedom appeared confirmed for
ever, and the victory which Rome seemed about to gain in the
British isles might secure her triumph in the west. Vain
omens! far different were the events in the womb of the future.</p>

<p>While England seemed binding herself to the court of Rome,
the general course of the church and of the world gave stronger
presage every day of the approaching emancipation of Christendom.
The respect which for so many centuries had hedged
in the Roman Pontiff was everywhere shaken; the Reform,
already firmly established in several states of Germany and
Switzerland, was extending in France, the Low Countries, and
Hungary, and beginning in Sweden, Denmark, and Scotland.
The South of Europe appeared indeed submissive to the Romish
church; but Spain, at heart, cared little for the pontifical infallibility;
and even Italy began to inquire whether the papal
dominion was not an obstacle to her prosperity. England, notwithstanding
appearances, was also going to throw off the yoke
of the bishops of the Tiber, and many faithful voices might
already be heard demanding that the word of God should be
acknowledged the supreme authority in the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO SORTS OF TEACHING.</div>

<p>The conquest of Christian Britain by the papacy occupied
all the seventh century, as we have seen. The sixteenth was
the counterpart of the seventh. The struggle which England
then had to sustain, in order to free herself from the power
that had enslaved her during nine hundred years, was full of
sudden changes; like those of the times of Augustine and Oswy.
This struggle indeed took place in each of the countries where
the church was reformed; but nowhere can it be traced in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
its diverse phases so distinctly as in Great Britain. The positive
work of the Reformation&mdash;that which consisted in recovering
the truth and life so long lost&mdash;was nearly the same everywhere;
but as regards the negative work&mdash;the struggle with the
popedom&mdash;we might almost say that other nations committed
to England the task by which they were all to profit. An
unenlightened piety may perhaps look upon the relations of the
court of London with the court of Rome, at the period of the
Reformation, as void of interest to the faith; but history will
not think the same. It has been too often forgotten that the
main point in this contest was not the divorce (which was only
the occasion), but the contest itself and its important consequences.
The divorce of Henry Tudor and Catherine of Aragon
is a secondary event; but the divorce of England and the popedom
is a primary event, one of the great evolutions of history,
a creative act (so to speak) which still exercises a normal influence
over the destinies of mankind. And accordingly everything
connected with it is full of instruction for us. Already a
great number of pious men had attached themselves to the
authority of God; but the king, and with him that part of the
nation, strangers to the evangelical faith, clung to Rome, which
Henry had so valiantly defended. The word of God had spiritually
separated England from the papacy; the <i>great matter</i>
separated it materially. There is a close relationship between
these two divorces, which gives extreme importance to the
process between Henry and Catherine. When a great revolution
is to be effected in the bosom of a people (we have the
Reformation particularly in view), God instructs the minority
by the Holy Scriptures, and the majority by the dispensations
of the divine government. Facts undertake to push forward
those whom the more spiritual voice of the word leaves behind.
England, profiting by this great teaching of facts, has thought
it her duty ever since to avoid all contact with a power that
had deceived her; she has thought that popery could not have
the dominion over a people without infringing on its vitality,
and that it was only by emancipating themselves from this
priestly dictatorship that modern nations could advance safely
in the paths of liberty, order, and greatness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE'S HESITATION.</div>

<p>For more than a year, as Henry's complaints testify, Anne
continued deaf to his homage. The despairing king saw that he
must set other springs to work, and taking Lord Rochford aside,
he unfolded his plans to him. The ambitious father promised
to do all in his power to influence his daughter. "The divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is a settled thing," he said to her; "you have no control over it.
The only question is, whether it shall be you or another who
shall give an heir to the crown. Bear in mind that terrible revolutions
threaten England, if the king has no son." Thus did
every thing combine to weaken Anne's resolution. The voice
of her father, the interests of her country, the king's love, and
doubtless some secret ambition, influenced her to grasp the
proffered sceptre. These thoughts haunted her in society, in
solitude, and even in her dreams. At one time she imagined
herself on the throne, distributing to the people her charities
and the word of God; at another, in some obscure exile, leading
a useless life, in tears and ignominy. When, in the sports of
her imagination, the crown of England appeared all glittering
before her, she at first rejected it; but afterwards that regal
ornament seemed so beautiful, and the power it conferred so
enviable, that she repelled it less energetically. Anne still refused,
however, to give the so ardently solicited assent.</p>

<p>Henry, vexed by her hesitation, wrote to her frequently, and
almost always in French. As the court of Rome makes use of
these letters, which are kept in the Vatican, to abuse the Reformation,
we think it our duty to quote them. The theft
committed by a cardinal has preserved them for us; and we shall
see that, far from supporting the calumnies that have been
spread abroad, they tend, on the contrary, to refute them. We
are far from approving their contents as a whole; but we cannot
deny to the young lady, to whom they are addressed, the possession
of noble and generous sentiments.</p>

<p>Henry, unable to support the anguish caused by Anne's refusal,
wrote to her, as it is generally supposed, in May 1528:<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"By revolving in my mind the contents of your last letters,
I have put myself into great agony, not knowing how to interpret
them, whether to my disadvantage, as I understand some
passages, or not, as I conclude from others. I beseech you
earnestly to let me know your real mind as to the love between
us two. It is needful for me to obtain this answer of you, having
been for a whole year wounded with the dart of love, and
not yet assured whether I shall succeed in finding a place in
your heart and affection. This uncertainty has hindered me of
late from declaring you my mistress, lest it should prove that
you only entertain for me an ordinary regard. But if you please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to do the duty of a true and loyal mistress, I promise you that
not only the name shall be given to you, but also that I will
take you for my mistress, casting off all others that are in competition
with you, out of my thoughts and affection, and serving
you only. I beg you to give an entire answer to this my rude
letter, that I may know on what and how far I may depend.
But if it does not please you to answer me in writing, let me
know some place where I may have it by word of mouth,
and I will go thither with all my heart. No more for fear of
tiring you. Written by the hand of him who would willingly

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S SECOND LETTER.</div>

<p>Such were the affectionate, and we may add (if we think of
the time and the man) the respectful terms employed by Henry
in writing to Anne Boleyn. The latter, without making any
promises, betrayed some little affection for the king, and added
to her reply an emblematical jewel, representing "a solitary
damsel in a boat tossed by the tempest," wishing thus to make
the prince understand the dangers to which his love exposed
her. Henry was ravished and immediately replied:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p>"For a present so valuable, that nothing could be more (considering
the whole of it,) I return you my most hearty thanks,
not only on account of the costly diamond, and the ship in which
the solitary damsel is tossed about, but chiefly for the fine interpretation,
and the too humble submission which your goodness hath
made to me. Your favour I will always seek to preserve, and
this is my firm intention and hope, according to the matter, <i>aut
illic aut nullibi</i>.</p>

<p>"The demonstrations of your affections are such, the fine
thoughts of your letter so cordially expressed, that they oblige
me for ever to honour, love, and serve you sincerely. I beseech
you to continue in the same firm and constant purpose, and
assuring you that, on my part, I will not only make you a suitable
return, but outdo you, so great is the loyalty of the heart
that desires to please you. I desire, also, that if, at any time
before this, I have in any way offended you, that you would
give me the same absolution that you ask, assuring you, that
hereafter my heart shall be dedicated to you alone. I wish my
person were so too. God can do it, if he pleases, <i>to whom I
pray once a-day</i> for that end, hoping that at length <i>my prayers
will be heard</i>. I wish the time may be short, but I shall think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S THIRD AND FOURTH LETTERS.</div>

<p>Henry was a passionate lover, and history is not called upon
to vindicate that cruel prince; but in the preceding letter we
cannot discover the language of a seducer. It is impossible to
imagine the king praying to God <i>once a-day</i>, for anything but
a lawful union. These daily prayers seem to present the matter
in a different light from that which Romanist writers have imagined.</p>

<p>Henry thought himself more advanced than he really was.
Anne then shrank back; embarrassed by the position she held
at court, she begged for one less elevated. The king submitted,
although very vexed at first:</p>


<blockquote><p>"Nevertheless that it belongeth not to a gentleman," he
wrote to her, "to put his <i>mistress</i> in the situation of a <i>servant</i>,
yet, by following your wishes, I would willingly concede it, if
by that means you are less uncomfortable in the place you shall
choose than in that where you have been placed by me. I
thank you most cordially that you are pleased still to bear me
in your remembrance.</p>

<p class="signature">
"H. T."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Anne, having retired in May to Hever castle, her father's
residence, the king wrote to her as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My Mistress and my Friend,
</p>

<p>"My heart and I surrender ourselves into your hands, and
we supplicate to be commended to your good graces, and that
by absence your affections may not be diminished to us. For
that would be to augment our pain, which would be a great
pity, since absence gives enough, and more than I ever thought
could be felt. This brings to my mind a fact in astronomy,
which is, that the longer the days are, the farther off is the sun,
and yet the more scorching is his heat. Thus is it with our
love; absence has placed distance between us, nevertheless fervour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
increases, at least on my part. I hope the same from you,
assuring you that in my case the anguish of absence is so great
that it would be intolerable were it not for the firm hope I have
of your indissoluble affection towards me. In order to remind
you of it, and because I cannot in person be in your presence,
I send you the thing which comes nearest that is possible, that
is to say, my picture, and the whole device, which you already
know of,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> set in bracelets; wishing myself in their place when it

</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE GIVES HER CONSENT.</div>

<p>Pressed by her father, her uncles, and by Henry, Anne's
firmness was shaken. That crown, rejected by Renée and by
Margaret, dazzled the young Englishwoman; every day she found
some new charm in it; and gradually familiarizing herself with
her new future, she said at last: "If the king becomes free, I
shall be willing to marry him." This was a great fault; but
Henry was at the height of joy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY STRIVES TO DISSUADE HENRY.</div>

<p>The courtiers watched with observant eyes these developments
of the king's affection, and were already preparing the homage
which they proposed to lay at Anne Boleyn's feet. But there
was one man at court whom Henry's resolution filled with sorrow;
this was Wolsey. He had been the first to suggest to the
king the idea of separating from Catherine; but if Anne is to
succeed her, there must be no divorce. He had first alienated
Catherine's party; he was now going to irritate that of the Boleyns;
accordingly he began to fear that whatever might be the issue
of this affair, it would cause his ruin. He took frequent walks
in his park at Hampton Court, accompanied by the French ambassador,
the confidant of his sorrows: "I would willingly lose
one of my fingers," he said, "if I could only have two hours'
conversation with the king of France." At another time,
fancying all England was pursuing him, he said with alarm,
"The king my master and all his subjects will cry murder against
me; they will fall upon me more fiercely than on a Turk, and
all Christendom will rise against me!" The next day Wolsey,
to gain the French ambassador, gave him a long history of what
he had done for France <i>against the wishes of all England</i>: "I
need much dexterity in my affairs," he added, "and must use a
terrible <i>alchymy</i>."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> But alchymy could not save him. Rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
has so much anguish been veiled beneath such grandeur. Du
Bellay was moved with pity at the sight of the unhappy man's
sufferings. "When he gives way," he wrote to Montmorency,
"it lasts a day together;&mdash;he is continually sighing.&mdash;You have
never seen a man in such anguish of mind."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>In truth Wolsey's reason was tottering. That fatal idea of
the divorce was the cause of all his woes, and to be able to recall
it, he would have given, not a <i>finger</i> only, but an arm, and
perhaps more. It was too late; Henry had started his car down
the steep, and whoever attempted to stop it would have been
crushed beneath its wheels. However, the cardinal tried to
obtain something. Francis I had intercepted a letter from
Charles V in which the emperor spoke of the divorce as likely
to raise the English nation in revolt. Wolsey caused this letter
to be read to the king, in the hope that it would excite his serious
apprehensions; but Henry only <i>frowned</i>, and Du Bellay, to
whom the monarch ascribed the report on these troubles foreboded
by Charles, received "a gentle lash."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> This was the sole-result
of the man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>Wolsey now resolved to broach this important subject in a
straightforward manner. The step might prove his ruin; but
if he succeeded he was saved and the popedom with him. Accordingly
one day (shortly before the sweating sickness broke
out, says Du Bellay, probably in June 1528) Wolsey openly
prayed the king to renounce his design; his own reputation, he
told him, the prosperity of England, the peace of Europe, the
safety of the church,&mdash;all required it; besides the pope would
never grant the divorce. While the cardinal was speaking,
Henry's face grew black; and before he had concluded the king's
anger broke out. "The king used terrible words," said Du
Bellay. He would have given a thousand Wolseys for one Anne
Boleyn. "No other than God shall take her from me," was
his most decided resolution.</p>

<p>Wolsey, now no longer doubting of his disgrace, began to take
his measures accordingly. He commenced building in several
places, in order to win the affections of the common people; he
took great care of his bishoprics, in order that they might ensure
him an easy retreat; he was affable to the courtiers; and
thus covered the earth with flowers to deaden his fall. Then
he would sigh as if he were disgusted with honours; and would
celebrate the charms of solitude.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> He did more than this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Seeing plainly that the best way of recovering the king's favour
would be to conciliate Anne Boleyn, he made her the most
handsome presents,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> and assured her that all his efforts would
now be directed to raise her to the throne of England. Anne
believing these declarations replied, that she would help him in
her turn, "As long as any breath was in her body."<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> Even
Henry had no doubt that the cardinal had profited by his
lesson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SWEATING SICKNESS.</div>

<p>Thus were all parties restless and uneasy&mdash;Henry desiring to
marry Lady Anne, the courtiers to get rid of Wolsey, and the
latter to remain in power&mdash;when a serious event appeared to
put every one in harmony with his neighbour. About the middle
of June, the terrible sweating sickness (<i>sudor anglicus</i>)
broke out in England. The citizens of London, "thick as flies,"
said Du Bellay,<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> suddenly feeling pains in the head and heart,
rushed from the streets or shops to their chambers, began to
sweat, and took to their beds. The disease made frightful and
rapid progress, a burning heat preyed on their limbs; if they
chanced to uncover themselves, the perspiration ceased, delirium
came on, and in four hours the victim was dead and "stiff as a
wall,"<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> says the French ambassador. Every family was in
mourning. Sir Thomas More, kneeling by his daughter's bedside,
burst into tears, and called upon God to save his beloved
Margaret.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Wolsey, who was at Hampton Court, suspecting
nothing amiss, arrived in London as usual to preside in the
court of Chancery; but he ordered his horses to be saddled
again immediately and rode back. In four days, 2000 persons
died in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S TERROR.</div>

<p>The court was at first safe from the contagion; but on the
fourth day one of Anne Boleyn's ladies was attacked; it was as
if a thunderbolt had fallen on the palace. The king removed
with all haste, and staid at a place twelve miles off, for he was
not prepared to die. He ordered Anne to return to her father,
invited the queen to join him, and took up his residence at
Waltham. His real conscience awoke only in the presence of
death. Four of his attendants and a friar, Anne's confessor,
as it would appear,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> falling ill, the king departed for Hunsdon.
He had been there two days only when Powis, Carew, Carton,
and others of his court, were carried off in two or three hours.
Henry had met an enemy whom he could not vanquish. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
quitted the place attacked by the disease; he removed to another
quarter; and when the sickness laid hold of any of his attendants
in his new retreat, he again left that for a new asylum.
Terror froze his blood; he wandered about pursued by that
terrible scythe whose sweep might perhaps reach him; he cut
off all communication, even with his servants; shut himself up
in a room at the top of an isolated tower; ate all alone, and
would see no one but his physician;<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> he prayed, fasted, confessed,
became reconciled with the queen; took the sacrament every
Sunday and feast day; received <i>his Maker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> to use the words of
a gentleman of his chamber; and the queen and Wolsey did the
same. Nor was that all: his councillor, Sir Brian Tuke, was
sick in Essex; but that mattered not; the king ordered him to
come to him, even in his litter; and on the 20th of June, Henry
after hearing three masses (he had never done so much before
in one day) said to Tuke: "I want you to write <i>my will</i>." He
was not the only one who took that precaution. "There were
<i>a hundred thousand</i> made," says Du Bellay.</p>

<p>During this time, Anne in her retirement at Hever was calm
and collected; she prayed much, particularly for the king and
for Wolsey.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> But Henry, far less submissive, was very anxious.
"The uneasiness my doubts about your health gave me," he
wrote to her, "disturbed and frightened me exceedingly; but
now, since you have as yet felt nothing, I hope it is with you
as it is with us.... I beg you, my entirely beloved, not to
frighten yourself, or be too uneasy at our absence, for wherever
I am, I am yours. And yet we must sometimes submit to our
misfortunes, for whoever will struggle against fate, is generally
but so much the farther from gaining his end. Wherefore, comfort
yourself and take courage, and make this misfortune as easy
to you as you can."<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>As he received no news, Henry's uneasiness increased; he sent
to Anne a messenger and a letter: "to acquit myself of the
duty of a true servant, I send you this letter, beseeching you to
apprize me of your welfare, which I pray may continue as long
as I desire mine own."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S TERRORS.</div>

<p>Henry's fears were well founded; the malady became more
severe; in four hours eighteen persons died at the archbishop of
Canterbury's; Anne Boleyn herself and her brother also caught
the infection. The king was exceedingly agitated; Anne alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
appeared calm; the strength of her character raised her above
exaggerated fears; but her enemies ascribed her calmness to
other motives. "Her ambition is stronger than death," they
said. "The king, queen, and cardinal tremble for their lives,
but she ... she would die content if she died a queen."
Henry once more changed his residence. All the gentlemen of
his privy-chamber were attacked with one exception; "he remained
alone, keeping himself apart," says Du Bellay, and confessed
every day. He wrote again to Anne, sending her his
physician, Dr. Butts:<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> "The most displeasing news that could
occur came to me suddenly at night. On three accounts I must
lament it. One, to hear of the illness of my mistress, whom I
esteem more than all the world, and whose health I desire as I
do my own. I would willingly bear half of what you suffer to
cure you. The second, from the fear that I shall have to endure
my wearisome absence much longer, which has hitherto
given me all the vexation that was possible; and when gloomy
thoughts filled my mind, then I pray God to remove far from
me such troublesome and rebellious ideas. The third, because
my physician, in whom I have most confidence, is absent. Yet,
from the want of him, I send you my second, and hope that he
will soon make you well. I shall then love him more than
ever. I beseech you to be guided by his advice in your illness.
By your doing this, I hope soon to see you again, which will be
to me a greater comfort than all the precious jewels in the
world."</p>

<p>The pestilence soon broke out with more violence around
Henry; he fled in alarm to Hatfield, taking with him only the
gentleman of his chamber; he next quitted this place for Tittenhanger,
a house belonging to Wolsey, whence he commanded
general processions throughout the kingdom in order to avert
this scourge of God.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> At the same time he wrote to Wolsey:
"As soon as any one falls ill in the place where you are, fly to
another; and go thus from place to place." The poor cardinal
was still more alarmed than Henry. As soon as he felt the
slightest perspiration, he fancied himself a dead man. "I entreat
your highness," he wrote trembling to the king on the 5th
of July, "to show yourself full of pity for my soul; these are
perhaps the last words I shall address to you ... the whole
world will see by my last testament that you have not bestowed
your favour upon an ungrateful man." The king, perceiving
that Wolsey's mind was affected, bade him "put apart fear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
fantasies,"<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> and wear a cheerful humour in the midst of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISSIMULATION AT COURT.</div>

<p>At last the sickness began to diminish, and immediately the
desire to see Anne revived in Henry's bosom. On the 18th of
August she re-appeared at court, and all the king's thoughts
were now bent on the divorce.</p>

<p>But this business seemed to proceed in inverse ratio to his
desires. There was no news of Campeggio; was he lost in the
Alps or at sea? Did his gout detain him in some village, or was
the announcement of his departure only a feint? Anne Boleyn
herself was uneasy, for she attached great importance to Campeggio's
coming. If the church annulled the king's first marriage,
Anne seeing the principal obstacle removed, thought she
might accept Henry's hand. She therefore wrote to Wolsey:
"I long to hear from you news of the legate, for I do hope (an'
they come from you) they shall be very good." The king added
in a postscript: "The not hearing of the legate's arrival in
France causeth us somewhat to muse. Notwithstanding we trust
by your diligence and vigilancy (with the assistance of Almighty
God) shortly to be eased out of that trouble."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>But still there was no news. While waiting for the long
desired ambassador, every one at the English court played his
part as well as he could. Anne, whether from conscience, prudence,
or modesty, refused the honours which the king would
have showered upon her, and never approached Catherine but
with marks of profound respect. Wolsey had the look of desiring
the divorce, while in reality he dreaded it, as fated to
cause his ruin and that of the popedom. Henry strove to conceal
the motives which impelled him to separate from the queen;
to the bishops, he spoke of his <i>conscience</i>, to the nobility <i>of an
heir</i>, and to all of the sad obligation which compelled him to
put away so justly beloved a princess. In the meanwhile, he
seemed to live on the best terms with her, from what Du Bellay
says.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> But Catherine was the one who best dissembled her
sentiments; she lived with the king as during their happiest
days, treated Anne with every kindness, adopted an elegant
costume, encouraged music and dancing in her apartments, often
appeared in public, and seemed desirous of captivating by her
gracious smiles the good-will of England. This was a mournful
comedy, destined to end in tragedy full of tears and agony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COVERDALE AND INSPIRATION.</div>

<p>While these scenes were acting in the royal palaces, far
different discussions were going on among the people. After
having dwelt for some time on the agitations of the court, we
gladly return to the lowly disciples of the divine word. The
Reformation of England (and this is its characteristic) brings
before us by turns the king upon his throne, and the laborious
artisan in his humble cottage; and between these two extremes
we meet with the doctor in his college, and the priest in his
pulpit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILES COVERDALE.</div>

<p>Among the young men trained at Cambridge under Barnes's
instruction, and who had aided him at the time of his trial, was
Miles Coverdale, afterwards bishop of Exeter, a man distinguished
by his zeal for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Some time
after the prior's fall, on Easter Eve, 1527, Coverdale and Cromwell
met at the house of Sir Thomas More, when the former
exhorted the Cambridge student to apply himself to the study
of sacred learning.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> The lapse of his unhappy master had
alarmed Coverdale, and he felt the necessity of withdrawing
from that outward activity which had proved so fatal to Barnes.
He therefore turned to the Scriptures, read them again and
again, and perceived, like Tyndale, that the reformation of the
church must be effected by the word of God. The inspiration
of that word, the only foundation of its sovereign authority,
had struck Coverdale. "Wherever the Scripture is known it
reformeth all things. And why? Because it is given <i>by
the inspiration of God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> This fundamental principle of the
Reformation in England must, in every age, be that of the
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>Coverdale found happiness in his studies: "Now," he said,
"I begin to taste of Holy Scriptures! Now, honour be to God!
I am set to the most sweet smell of holy letters."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> He did not
stop there, but thought it his duty to attempt in England the
work which Tyndale was prosecuting in Germany. The Bible
was so important in the eyes of these Christians, that two translations
were undertaken simultaneously. "Why should other
nations," said Coverdale, "be more plenteously provided for
with the Scriptures in their mother-tongue than we?"<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>&mdash;"Beware
of translating the Bible!" exclaimed the partisans of the
schoolmen; "your labour will only make divisions in the faith
and in the people of God."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>&mdash;"God has now given his church,"
replied Coverdale, "the gifts of translating and of printing; we
must improve them." And if any friends spoke of Tyndale's
translation, he answered: "Do not you know that when many
are starting together, every one doth his best to be nighest the
mark?"<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>&mdash;"But Scripture ought to exist in Latin only,"
objected the priests.&mdash;"No," replied Coverdale again, "the Holy
Ghost is as much the author of it in the Hebrew, Greek, French,
Dutch, and English, as in Latin.... The word of God is of
like authority, in what language soever the Holy Ghost speaketh
it."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> This does not mean that translations of Holy Scripture
are inspired, but that the word of God, faithfully translated,
always possesses a divine authority.</p>

<p>Coverdale determined therefore to translate the Bible, and,
to procure the necessary books, he wrote to Cromwell, who, during
his travels, had made a collection of these precious writings.
"Nothing in the world I desire but books," he wrote; "like
Jacob, you have drunk of the dew of heaven.... I ask to
drink of your waters."<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> Cromwell did not refuse Coverdale his
treasures. "Since the Holy Ghost moves you to bear the cost
of this work," exclaimed the latter, "God gives me boldness to
labour in the same."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> He commenced without delay, saying:
"Whosoever believeth not the Scripture, believeth not Christ;
and whoso refuseth it, refuseth God also."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> Such were the
foundations of the reformed church in England.</p>

<p>Coverdale did not undertake to translate the Scriptures as a
mere literary task: the Spirit which had inspired him spoke to
his heart; and tasting their life-giving promises, he expressed his
happiness in pious songs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYBALL AT BUMPSTEAD.</div>

<p>Coverdale did not remain long in the solitude he desired.
The study of the Bible, which had attracted him to it, soon
drew him out of it. A revival was going on in Essex; John Tyball,
an inhabitant of Bumpstead, having learnt to find in Jesus
Christ the <i>true bread from heaven</i>, did not stop there. One day
as he was reading the first epistle to the Corinthians, these words:
"eat of this <i>bread</i>," and "drink of this <i>cup</i>," repeated four times
within a few verses, convinced him that there was no transubstantiation.
"A priest has no power to create the body of
the Lord," said he, "Christ truly is present in the Eucharist,
but he is there only <i>for him that believeth</i>, and by a spiritual
presence and action only." Tyball, disgusted with the Romish
clergy and worship, and convinced that Christians are
called to a universal priesthood, soon thought that men could
do without a special ministry, and without denying the offices
mentioned in Scripture, as some Christians have done since, he
attached no importance to them. "Priesthood is not necessary,<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>"
he said: "every layman may administer the sacraments as well
as a priest." The minister of Bumpstead, one Richard Foxe,
and next a greyfriar of Colchester named Meadow, were successively
converted by Tyball's energetic preaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSION OF TOPLEY AND PYKAS.</div>

<p>Coverdale, who was living not far from these parts, having
heard speak of this religious revival, came to Bumpstead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
went into the pulpit in the spring of 1528, to proclaim the
treasures contained in Scripture. Among his hearers was an
Augustine monk, named Topley, who was supplying Foxe's
place during his absence. This monk, while staying at the
parsonage, had found a copy of Wickliffe's <i>Wicket</i>, which he read
eagerly. His conscience was wounded by it, and all seemed to
totter about him.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> He had gone to church full of doubt,
and after divine service he waited upon the preacher, exclaiming:
"O my sins, my sins!" "Confess yourself to God," said Coverdale,
"and not to a priest. God accepteth the confession which
cometh from the heart, and blotteth out all your sins."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> The
monk believed in the forgiveness of God, and became a zealous
evangelist for the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The divine word had hardly lighted one torch, before that kindled
another. At Colchester, in the same county, a worthy
man named Pykas, had received a copy of the Epistles of Saint
Paul from his mother, with this advice: "My son, live according
to these writings, and not according to the teaching of the
clergy." Some time after, Pykas having bought a New Testament,
and "read it thoroughly many times,"<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> a total change took
place in him. "We must be baptized by the Holy Ghost," he
said, and these words passed like a breath of life over his simple-minded
hearers. One day, Pykas having learnt that Bilney, the
first of the Cambridge doctors who had known the power of God's
word, was preaching at Ipswich, he proceeded thither, for he never
refused to listen to a priest, when that priest proclaimed the truth.
"O, what a sermon! how full of the Holy Ghost!" exclaimed Pykas.</p>

<p>From that period meetings of the brothers in Christ (for thus
they were called) increased in number. They read the New
Testament, and each imparted to the others what he had received
for the instruction of all. One day when the twenty-fourth
chapter of Matthew had been read, Pykas, who was sometimes
wrong in the spiritual interpretation of Scripture, remarked:
"When the Lord declares that <i>not one stone of the temple shall be
left upon another</i>, he speaks of those haughty priests who persecute
those whom they call heretics, and who pretend to be the
temple of God. God will destroy them all." After protesting
against the priest, he protested against the host: "The real
body of Jesus Christ is in the Word," he said; "God is in the
Word, the Word is in God.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> God and the Word cannot be
separated. Christ is the living Word that nourishes the soul."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
These humble preachers increased. Even women knew the
Epistles and Gospels by heart; Marion Matthew, Dorothy Long,
Catherine Swain, Alice Gardiner, and, above all, Gyrling's wife,
who had been in service with a priest lately burnt for heresy,
took part in these gospel meetings. And it was not in cottages
only that the glad tidings were then proclaimed; Bower Hall,
the residence of the squires of Bumpstead, was open to Foxe,
Topley, and Tyball, who often read the Holy Scriptures in the
great hall of the mansion, in the presence of the master and all
their household: a humble Reformation more real than that
effected by Henry VIII.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO FORMS OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>There was, however, some diversity of opinion among these
brethren. "All who have begun to believe," said Tyball, Pykas,
and others, "ought to meet together to hear the word and increase
in faith. We pray in common ... and that constitutes
a church." Coverdale, Bilney, and Latimer willingly recognised
these incomplete societies, in which the members met simply as
<i>disciples</i>; they believed them necessary at a period when the
church was forming. These societies (in the reformers' views)
proved that organization has not the priority in the Christian
church, as Rome maintains, and that this priority belongs to the
faith and the life. But this imperfect form they also regarded
as provisional. To prevent numerous dangers, it was necessary
that this society should be succeeded by another, the church of
the New Testament, with its elders or bishops, and deacons.
The word, they thought, rendered a ministry of the word necessary;
and for its proper exercise not only piety was required,
but a knowledge of the sacred languages, the gift of eloquence,
its exercise and perfection. However, there was no division
among these Christians upon secondary matters.</p>

<p>For some time the bishop of London watched this movement
with uneasiness. He caused Hacker to be arrested, who, for
six years past, had gone from house to house reading the Bible
in London and Essex; examined and threatened him, inquired
carefully after the names of those who had shown him hospitality;
and the poor man in alarm had given up about forty of
his brethren. Sebastian Harris, priest of Kensington, Forman,
rector of All Hallows, John and William Pykas, and many
others, were summoned before the bishop. They were taken
to prison; they were led before the judges; they were put in the
stocks; they were tormented in a thousand ways. Their minds
became confused; their thoughts wandered; and many made the
confessions required by their persecutors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONMOUTH ARRESTED.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>The adversaries of the gospel, proud of this success, now
desired a more glorious victory. If they could not reach Tyndale,
had they not in London the patron of his work, Monmouth,
the most influential of the merchants, and a follower of
the true faith? The clergy had made religion their business,
and the Reformation restored it to the people. Nothing offended
the priests so much, as that laymen should claim the right
to believe without their intervention, and even to propagate the
faith. Sir Thomas More, one of the most amiable men of the
sixteenth century, participated in their hatred. He wrote to
Cochlæus: "Germany now daily bringeth forth monsters more
deadly than what Africa was wont to do;<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> but, alas! she is not
alone. Numbers of Englishmen, who would not a few years
ago even hear Luther's name mentioned, are now publishing his
praises! England is now like the sea, which swells and heaves
before a great storm, without any wind stirring it."<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> More felt
particularly irritated, because the boldness of the gospellers had
succeeded to the timidity of the Lollards. "The heretics," he
said, "have put off hypocrisy, and put on impudence." He
therefore resolved to set his hand to the work.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May 1529, Monmouth was in his shop, when
an usher came and summoned him to appear before Sir J.
Dauncies, one of the privy council. The pious merchant obeyed,
striving to persuade himself that he was wanted on some matter
of business; but in this he was deceived, as he soon found out.
"What letters and books have you lately received from abroad?"<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>
asked with some severity, Sir Thomas More, who, with Sir
William Kingston, was Sir John's colleague. "None," replied
Monmouth. "What aid have you given to any persons living
on the continent?"&mdash;"None, for these last three years. William
Tyndale abode with me six months," he continued, "and his
life was what a good priest's ought to be. I gave him ten
pounds at the period of his departure, but nothing since. Besides,
he is not the only one I have helped; the bishop of
London's chaplain, for instance, has received of me more than
£50."&mdash;"What books have you in your possession?" The
merchant named the New Testament and some other works.
"All these books have lain more than two years on my table,
and I never heard that either priests, friars, or laymen learnt
any great errors from them."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> More tossed his head. "It is
a hard matter," he used to say, "to put a dry stick in the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
without its burning, or to nourish a snake in our bosom and
not be stung by it.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>&mdash;That is enough," he continued, "we shall
go and search your house." Not a paper escaped their curiosity;
but they found nothing to compromise Monmouth; he was
however sent to the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HE IS INTERROGATED BY MORE.</div>

<p>After some interval the merchant was again brought before
his judges. "You are accused," said More, "of having bought
Martin Luther's tracts; of maintaining those who are translating
the Scriptures into English; of subscribing to get the New
Testament printed in English, with or without glosses; of having
imported it into the kingdom; and, lastly, of having said
that faith alone is sufficient to save a man."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>There was matter enough to burn several men. Monmouth,
feeling convinced that Wolsey alone had power to deliver him,
resolved to apply to him. "What will become of my poor
workmen in London and in the country during my imprisonment?"
he wrote to the cardinal. "They must have their
money every week; who will give it them?... Besides, I
make considerable sales in foreign countries, which bring large
returns to his majesty's customs.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> If I remain in prison, this
commerce is stopped, and of course all the proceeds for the
exchequer." Wolsey, who was as much a statesman as a
churchman, began to melt; on the eve of a struggle with the
pope and the emperor, he feared, besides, to make the people
discontented. Monmouth was released from prison. As alderman,
and then as sheriff of London, he was faithful until death,
and ordered in his last will that thirty sermons should be
preached by the most evangelical ministers in England, "to
make known the holy word of Jesus Christ."&mdash;"That is better,"
he thought, "than founding masses." The Reformation showed,
in the sixteenth century, that great activity in commerce might
be allied to great piety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE CHANGES.</div>

<p>While these persecutions were agitating the fields and the
capital of England, all had changed in the ecclesiastical world,
because all had changed in the political. The pope, pressed by
Henry VIII and intimidated by the armies of Francis I, had
granted the decretal and despatched Campeggio. But, on a
sudden, there was a new evolution; a change of events brought
a change of counsels. Doria had gone over to the emperor; his
fleet had restored abundance to Naples; the army of Francis I,
ravaged by famine and pestilence, had capitulated, and Charles
V, triumphant in Italy, had said proudly to the pope: "We are
determined to defend the queen of England against King Henry's
injustice."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>Charles having recovered his superiority, the affrighted pope
opened his eyes to the justice of Catherine's cause. "Send four
messengers after Campeggio," said he to his officers; "and let
each take a different road; bid them travel with all speed and
deliver our despatches to him."<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> They overtook the legate,
who opened the pope's letters. "In the first place," said Clement
VII to him, "protract your journey. In the second place,
when you reach England, use every endeavour to reconcile the
king and queen. In the third place, if you do not succeed,
persuade the queen to take the veil. And in the last place, if
she refuses, do not pronounce any sentence favourable to the
divorce without a new and express order from me. This is the
essential: <i>Summum et maximum mandatum</i>." The ambassador
of the sovereign pontiff had a mission to do nothing. This instruction
is sometimes as effective as any.</p>

<p>Campeggio, the youngest of the cardinals, was the most intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and the slowest; and this slowness caused his selection
by the pope. He understood his master. If Wolsey was
Henry's spur to urge on Campeggio, the latter was Clement's
bridle to check Wolsey.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> One of the judges of the divorce was
about to pull forwards, the other backwards; thus the business
stood a chance of not advancing at all, which was just what the
pope required.</p>

<p>The legate, very eager to relax his speed, spent three months
on his journey from Italy to England. He should have embarked
for France on the 23rd of July; but the end of August
was approaching, and no one knew in that country what had
become of him.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> At length they learnt that he had reached
Lyons on the 22nd of August. The English ambassador in
France sent him horses, carriages, plate, and money, in order to
hasten his progress; the legate complained of the <i>gout</i>, and
Gardiner found the greatest difficulty in getting him to move.
Henry wrote every day to Anne Boleyn, complaining of the slow
progress of the nuncio. "He arrived in Paris last Sunday or
Monday," he says at the beginning of September; "Monday
next we shall hear of his arrival in Calais, and then I shall
obtain what I have so longed for, to God's pleasure and both
our comforts."<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE'S LETTER TO WOLSEY.</div>

<p>At the same time, this impatient prince sent message after
message to accelerate the legate's rate of travelling.</p>

<p>Anne began to desire a future which surpassed all that her
youthful imagination had conceived, and her agitated heart expanded
to the breath of hope. She wrote to Wolsey:</p>

<blockquote><p>"This shall be to give unto your grace, as I am most bound,
my humble thanks for the great pain and travail that your
grace doth take in studying, by your wisdom and great diligence,
how to bring to pass honourably the greatest wealth [well-being]
that is possible to come to any creature living; and in especial
remembering how wretched and unworthy I am in comparison
to his highness.... Now, good my lord, your discretion
may consider as yet how little it is in my power to recompense
you but alonely [only] with my good will; the which I
assure you, look what thing in this world I can imagine to do
you pleasure in, you shall find me the gladdest woman in the
world to do it."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">A CRUEL PROPHECY.</div>

<p>But the impatience of the king of England and of Anne
seemed as if it would never be satisfied. Campeggio, on his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
through Paris, told Francis I that the divorce would never take
place, and that he should soon go to <i>Spain</i> to see Charles V....
This was significative. "The king of England
ought to know," said the indignant Francis to the duke of
Suffolk, "that Campeggio is <i>imperialist</i> at heart, and that his
mission in England will be a mere mockery."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>In truth, the Spanish and Roman factions tried every man&oelig;uvre
to prevent a union they detested. Anne Boleyn, queen
of England, signified not only Catherine humbled, but Charles
offended; the clerical party awakened, perhaps destroyed, and
the evangelical party put in its place. The Romish faction
found accomplices even in Anne's own family. Her brother
George's wife, a proud and passionate woman, and a rigid Roman
catholic, had sworn an implacable hatred against her young
sister. By this means wounds might be inflicted, even in the
domestic sanctuary, which would not be the less deep because
they were the work of her own kindred. One day we are told
that Anne found in her chamber a book of pretended prophecies,
in which was a picture representing a king, a queen shedding
tears, and at their feet a young lady headless. Anne turned
away her eyes with disgust. She desired, however, to know
what this emblem signified, and officious friends brought to her
one of those pretended wise men, so numerous at all times, who
abuse the credulity of the ignorant by professing to interpret
such mysteries. "This prophetic picture," he said, "represents
the history of the king and his wife." Anne was not credulous,
but she understood what her enemies meant to insinuate, and
dismissed the mock interpreter without betraying any signs of
fear; then turning to her favourite attendant, Anne Saville,
"Come hither, Nan," said she, "look at this book of prophecies;
this is the king, this the queen wringing her hands and mourning,
and this (putting her finger on the bleeding body) is <i>myself</i>,
with my head cut off."&mdash;The young lady answered with a shudder:
"If I thought it were true, I would not myself have him
were he an emperor."&mdash;"Tut, Nan," replied Anne Boleyn with
a sweet smile, "I think the book a bauble, and am resolved to
have him, that my issue may be royal, whatever may become of
me."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> This story is based on good authority, and there were
so many predictions of this kind afloat that it is very possible
one of them might come true; people afterwards recollected only
the prophecies confirmed by the events. But, be that as it may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
this young lady, so severely chastised in after-days, found in her
God an abundant consolation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF CAMPEGGIO.</div>

<p>At length Campeggio embarked at Calais on the 29th of
September, and unfortunately for him he had an excellent passage
across the channel. A storm to drive him back to the
French coast would have suited him admirably. But on the
1st of October he was at Canterbury, whence he announced his
arrival to the king. At this news, Henry forgot all the delays
which had so irritated him. "His majesty can never be sufficiently
grateful to your holiness for so great a favour," wrote
Wolsey to the pope; "but he will employ his riches, his kingdom,
his life even, and deserve the name of <i>Restorer of the
Church</i> as justly as he has gained that of <i>Defender of the Faith</i>."
This zeal alarmed Campeggio, for the pope wrote to him that
any proceeding which might irritate Charles would inevitably
cause the ruin of the church.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> The nuncio became more dilatory
than ever, and although he reached Canterbury on the 1st of
October, he did not arrive at Dartford until the 5th, thus taking
four days for a journey of about thirty miles.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile preparations were making to receive him in London.
Wolsey, feeling contempt for the poverty of the Roman
cardinals, and very uneasy about the equipage with which his
colleague was likely to make his entrance into the capital, sent
a number of showy chests, rich carpets, litters hung with
drapery, and harnessed mules. On the other hand Campeggio,
whose secret mission was to keep in the back-ground, and above
all to do nothing, feared these banners, and trappings, and all
the parade of a triumphal entry. Alleging therefore an attack
of gout in order to escape from the pomps his colleague had
prepared for him, he quietly took a boat, and thus reached the
palace of the bishop of Bath, where he was to lodge.</p>

<p>While the nuncio was thus proceeding unnoticed up the Thames,
the equipages sent by Wolsey entered London through the midst
of a gaping crowd, who looked on them with curiosity as if they
had come from the banks of the Tiber. Some of the mules
however took fright and ran away, the coffers fell off and burst
open, when there was a general rush to see their contents; but
to the surprise of all they were empty. This was an excellent
jest for the citizens of London. "Fine outside, empty inside;
a just emblem of the popedom, its embassy, and foolish pomps,"
they said; "a sham legate, a procession of masks, and the whole
a farce!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE'S INDECISION TERMINATED.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>Campeggio was come at last, and now what he dreaded most
was an audience. "I cannot move," he said, "or endure the
motion of a litter."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> Never had an attack of gout been more
seasonable. Wolsey, who paid him frequent visits, soon found
him to be his equal in cunning. To no purpose did he treat
him with every mark of respect, shaking his hand and making
much of him;<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> it was labour lost, the Roman nuncio would say
nothing, and Wolsey began to despair. The king, on the contrary,
was full of hope, and fancied he already had the act of
divorce in his portfolio, because he had the nuncio in his kingdom.</p>

<p>The greatest effect of the nuncio's arrival was the putting an
end to Anne Boleyn's indecision. She had several relapses: the
trials which she foresaw, and the grief Catherine must necessarily
feel, had agitated her imagination and disturbed her mind.
But when she saw the church and her own enemies prepared to
pronounce the king's divorce, her doubts were removed, and she
regarded as legitimate the position that was offered her. The
king, who suffered from her scruples, was delighted at this
change. "I desire to inform you," he wrote to her in English,
"what joy it is to me to understand of your conformableness
with reason, and of the suppressing of your inutile and vain
thoughts and fantasies with the bridle of reason. I assure you
all the greatness of this world could not counterpoise for my
satisfaction the knowledge and certainty thereof.... The
unfeigned sickness of this well-willing legate doth somewhat retard
his access to your person."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> It was therefore the determination
of the pope that made Anne Boleyn resolve to accept
Henry's hand; this is an important lesson for which we are indebted
to the <i>Vatican letters</i>. We should be grateful to the
papacy for having so carefully preserved them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMPEGGIO'S INTERVIEW WITH THE QUEEN.</div>

<p>But the more Henry rejoiced, the more Wolsey despaired; he
would have desired to penetrate into Clement's thoughts, but
could not succeed. Imagining that De Angelis, the general of
the Spanish Observance, knew all the secrets of the pope and of
the emperor, he conceived the plan of kidnapping him. "If he
goes to Spain by sea," said he to Du Bellay, "a good brigantine
or two would do the business; and if by land, it will be easier
still." Du Bellay failed not (as he informs us himself) "to
tell him plainly that by such proceedings he would entirely forfeit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the pope's good will."&mdash;"What matter?" replied Wolsey,
"I have nothing to lose." As he said this, tears started to his
eyes.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> At last he made up his mind to remain ignorant of the
pontiff's designs, and wiped his eyes, awaiting, not without fear,
the interview between Henry and Campeggio.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October, a month after his arrival, the nuncio,
borne in a sedan chair of red velvet, was carried to court. He
was placed on the right of the throne, and his secretary in his
name delivered a high-sounding speech, saluting Henry with the
name of Saviour of Rome, <i>Liberator urbis</i>. "His majesty,"
replied Fox in the king's name, "has only performed the duties
incumbent on a Christian prince, and he hopes that the holy
see will bear them in mind."&mdash;"Well attacked, well defended,"
said Du Bellay. For the moment, a few Latin declamations got
the papal nuncio out of his difficulties.</p>

<p>Campeggio did not deceive himself: if the divorce were refused,
he foresaw the reformation of England. Yet he hoped
still, for he was assured that Catherine would submit to the
judgment of the church; and being fully persuaded that the
queen would refuse the holy father nothing, the nuncio began
"his approaches," as Du Bellay calls them. On the 27th of
October, the two cardinals waited on Catherine, and in flattering
terms insinuated that she might prevent the blow which threatened
her by voluntary retirement into a convent. And then, to
end all indecision in the queen's mind, Campeggio put on a severe
look and exclaimed: "How is it, madam, explain the mystery
to us? From the moment the holy father appointed us to examine
the question of your divorce, you have been seen not only
at court, but in public, wearing the most magnificent ornaments,
participating with an appearance of gaiety and satisfaction at
amusements and festivities which you had never tolerated before....
The church is in the most cruel embarrassment
with regard to you; the king, your husband, is in the greatest
perplexity; the princess, your daughter, is taken from you ...
and instead of shedding tears, you give yourself up to vanity.
Renounce the world, madam; enter a nunnery. Our holy father
himself requires this of you."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CATHERINE'S REPLY.</div>

<p>The agitated queen was almost fainting; stifling her emotion,
however, she said mildly but firmly: "Alas! my lords, is it now
a question whether I am the king's lawful wife or not, when I
have been married to him almost twenty years and no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
raised before?... Divers prelates and lords are yet alive
who then adjudged our marriage good and lawful,&mdash;and now to
say it is detestable! this is a great marvel to me, especially when
I consider what a wise prince the king's father was, and also the
natural love and affection my father, King Ferdinand, bare unto
me. I think that neither of these illustrious princes would have
made me contract an illicit union." At these words, Catherine's
emotion compelled her to stop.&mdash;"If I weep, my lords," she
continued almost immediately, "it is not for myself, it is for a
person dearer to me than my life. What! I should consent to
an act which deprives my daughter of a crown? No, I will not
sacrifice my child. I know what dangers threaten me. I am
only a weak woman, a stranger, without learning, advisers, or
friends ... and my enemies are skilful, learned in the laws,
and desirous to merit their master's favour ... and more
than that, even my judges are my enemies. Can I receive as
such," she said as she looked at Campeggio, "a man extorted
from the pope by manifest lying?... And as for you,"
added she, turning haughtily to Wolsey, "having failed in attaining
the tiara, you have sworn to revenge yourself on my
nephew the emperor ... and you have kept him true
promise; for all his wars and vexations, he may only thank you.
One victim was not enough for you. Forging abominable suppositions,
you desire to plunge his aunt into a frightful abyss....
But my cause is just, and I trust it in the Lord's hand."
After this bold language, the unhappy Catherine withdrew
to her apartments. The imminence of the danger effected
a salutary revolution in her; she laid aside her brilliant
ornaments, assumed the sober garments in which she is usually
represented, and passed days and nights in mourning and in
tears.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>Thus Campeggio saw his hopes deceived; he had thought to
find a nun, and had met a queen and a mother.... He
now proceeded to set every imaginable spring at work; as Catherine
would not renounce Henry, he must try and prevail upon
Henry to renounce his idea of separating from the queen. The
Roman legate therefore changed his batteries, and turned them
against the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S INTERVIEW WITH THE NUNCIO.</div>

<p>Henry, always impatient, went one day unannounced to Campeggio's
lodging, accompanied by Wolsey only:<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> "As we are
without witnesses," he said, taking his seat familiarly between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the two cardinals, "let us speak freely of our affairs.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>&mdash;How
shall you proceed?" But to his great astonishment and grief,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
the nuncio prayed him, with all imaginable delicacy, to renounce
the divorce.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> At these words the fiery Tudor burst out: "Is
this how the pope keeps his word? He sends me an ambassador
to annul my marriage, but in reality to confirm it." He made
a pause. Campeggio knew not what to say. Henry and Catherine
being equally persuaded of the justice of their cause, the
nuncio was in a dilemma. Wolsey himself suffered a martyrdom.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
The king's anger grew fiercer; he had thought the legate
would hasten to withdraw an imprudent expression, but Campeggio
was dumb. "I see that you have chosen your part,"
said Henry to the nuncio; "mine, you may be sure, will soon be
taken also. Let the pope only persevere in this way of acting,
and the apostolical see, covered with perpetual infamy, will be
visited with a frightful destruction."<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> The lion had thrown off
the lamb's skin which he had momentarily assumed. Campeggio
felt that he must appease the monarch. "Craft and delay"
were his orders from Rome; and with that view the pope had
provided him with the necessary arms. He hastened to produce
the famous <i>decretal</i> which pronounced the divorce. "The holy
father," he told the king, "ardently desires that this matter
should be terminated by a happy reconciliation between you and
the queen; but if that is impossible, you shall judge yourself
whether or not his holiness can keep his promises." He then
read the bull, and even showed it to Henry, without permitting
it, however, to leave his hands. This exhibition produced the
desired effect: Henry grew calm. "Now I am at ease again,"
he said; "this miraculous talisman revives all my courage. This
decretal is the efficacious remedy that will restore peace to my
oppressed conscience, and joy to my bruised heart.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> Write to
his holiness, that this immense benefit binds me to him so closely,
that he may expect from me more than his imagination can
conceive."</p>

<p>And yet a few clouds gathered shortly after in the king's
mind.</p>

<p>Campeggio having shown the bull had hastened to lock it up
again. Would he presume to keep it in his own hands? Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and Wolsey will leave no means untried to get possession of it;
that point gained, and victory is theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY REFUSED THE DECRETAL.</div>

<p>Wolsey having returned to the nuncio, he asked him for the
decretal with an air of candour as if it was the most natural
thing in the world. He desired, he said, to show it to the
king's privy-councillors. "The pope," replied Campeggio, "has
granted this bull, not to be used, but to be kept secret;<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> he
simply desired to show the king the good feeling by which he
was animated." Wolsey having failed, Henry tried his skill.
"Have the goodness to hand me the bull which you showed
me," said he. The nuncio respectfully refused. "For a single
moment," he said. Campeggio still refused. The haughty
Tudor retired, stifling his anger. Then Wolsey made another
attempt, and founded his demand on justice. "Like you, I am
delegated by his holiness to decide this affair," he said, "and I
wish to study the important document which is to regulate our
proceedings."&mdash;This was met by a new refusal. "What!" exclaimed
the minister of Henry VIII, "am I not, like you, a
cardinal?... like you, a judge? your colleague?" It
mattered not, the nuncio would not, by any means, let the
decretal go.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Clement was not deceived in the choice he had
made of Campeggio; the ambassador was worthy of his master.</p>

<p>It was evident that the pope in granting the bull had been
acting a part: this trick revolted the king. It was no longer
anger that he felt, but disgust. Wolsey knew that Henry's
contempt was more to be feared than his wrath. He grew
alarmed, and paid the nuncio another visit. "The <i>general</i> commission,"
he said, "is insufficient, the <i>decretal</i> commission alone
can be of service, and you do not permit us to read a word of
it.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>... The king and I place the greatest confidence in
the good intentions of his holiness, and yet we find our expectations
frustrated.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Where is that paternal affection with which
we had flattered ourselves? What prince has ever been trifled
with as the king of England is now? If this is the way in which
the <i>Defender of the Faith</i> is rewarded, Christendom will know
what those who serve Rome will have to expect from her, and
every power will withdraw its support. Do not deceive yourselves:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the foundation on which the holy see is placed is so very insecure
that the least movement will suffice to precipitate it into
everlasting ruin.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> What a sad futurity!... what inexpressible
torture!... whether I wake or sleep, gloomy
thoughts continually pursue me like a frightful nightmare."<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
This time Wolsey spoke the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NUNCIO REFUSES EVERYTHING.</div>

<p>But all his eloquence was useless; Campeggio refused to give
up the so much desired bull. When sending him, Rome had
told him: "Above all, do not succeed!" This means having
failed, there remained for Wolsey one other way of effecting the
divorce. "Well, then," he said to Campeggio, "let us pronounce
it ourselves."&mdash;"Far be it from us," replied the nuncio; "the
anger of the emperor will be so great, that the peace of Europe
will be broken for ever."&mdash;"I know how to arrange all that,"
replied the English cardinal, "in political matters you may trust
to me."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> The nuncio then took another tone, and proudly
wrapping himself up in his morality, he said: "I shall follow
the voice of my conscience; if I see that the divorce is possible,
I shall leap the ditch; if otherwise, I shall not."&mdash;"Your conscience!
that may be easily satisfied," rejoined Wolsey. "Holy
Scripture forbids a man to marry his brother's widow; now no
pope can grant what is forbidden by the law of God."&mdash;"The
Lord preserve us from such a principle," exclaimed the Roman
prelate; "the power of the pope is unlimited."&mdash;The nuncio had
hardly put his conscience forward before it stumbled; it bound
him to Rome and not to heaven. But for that matter, neither
public opinion nor Campeggio's own friends had any great idea
of his morality; they thought that to make him <i>leap the ditch</i>,
it was only requisite to know the price at which he might be
bought. The bishop of Bayonne wrote to Montmorency: "Put
at the close of a letter which I can show Campeggio something
<i>promissory</i>, that he shall have <i>benefices</i>.... That will cost
you nothing, and may serve in this matter of the marriage; for
I know that he is longing for something of the sort."&mdash;"What
is to be done then," said Wolsey at last, astonished at meeting
with a resistance to which he was unaccustomed. "I shall
inform the pope of what I have seen and heard," replied Campeggio,
"and I shall wait for his instructions." Henry was
forced to consent to this new course, for the nuncio hinted, that
if it were opposed he would go in person to Rome to ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
pontiff's orders, and he never would have returned. By this
means several months were gained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEOPLE SUPPORT CATHERINE.</div>

<p>During this time men's minds were troubled. The prospect
of a divorce between the king and queen had stirred the
nation; and the majority, particularly among the women,
declared against the king. "Whatever may be done," the people
said boldly, "whoever marries the princess Mary will be
king of England."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> Wolsey's spies informed him that Catherine
and Charles V had many devoted partizans even at the court.
He wished to make sure of this. "It is pretended," he said one
day in an indifferent tone, "that the emperor has boasted that
he will get the king driven from his realm, and that by his
majesty's own subjects.... What do you think of it, my
lords?"&mdash;"Tough against the spur," says Du Bellay, the lords
remained silent. At length, however, one of them more imprudent
than the rest, exclaimed: "Such a boast will make the
emperor lose more than a hundred thousand Englishmen." This
was enough for Wolsey. To <i>lose</i> them, he thought, Charles
must <i>have</i> them. If Catherine thought of levying war against
her husband, following the example of former queens of England,
she would have, then, a party ready to support her; this
became dangerous.</p>

<p>The king and the cardinal immediately took their measures.
More than 15,000 of Charles's subjects were ordered to leave
London; the arms of the citizens were seized, "in order that
they might have no worse weapon than the tongue;"<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> the Flemish
councillors accorded to Catherine were dismissed after they
had been heard by the king and Campeggio, "for they had no
commission to speak to <i>the other</i> [Wolsey]"&mdash;and finally, they
kept "a great and constant watch" upon the country. Men
feared an invasion of England, and Henry was not of a humour
to subject his kingdom to the pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S SPEECH.</div>

<p>This was not enough; the alarmed king thought it his duty
to come to an explanation with his people; and having summoned
the lords spiritual and temporal, the judges, the members of
the privy-council, the mayor and aldermen of the city, and
many of the gentry, to meet him at his palace of Bridewell on
the 13th of November,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> he said to them with a very condescending
air: "You know, my lords and gentlemen, that for these
twenty years past divine Providence has granted our country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
such prosperity as it had never known before. But in the
midst of all the glory that surrounds me, the thought of my
last hour often occurs to me,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and I fear that if I should die without
an heir, my death would cause more damage to my people
than my life has done them good. God forbid, that for want
of a legitimate king England should be again plunged into the
horrors of civil war!" Then calling to mind the illegalities invalidating
his marriage with Catherine, the king continued:
"These thoughts have filled my mind with anxiety, and are
continually pricking my conscience. This is the only motive,
and God is my witness,<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> which has made me lay this matter before
the pontiff. As touching the queen, she is a woman incomparable
in gentleness, humility, and buxomness, as I these twenty
years have had experiment of; so that if I were to marry again,
if the marriage might be good, I would surely choose her above
all other women. But if it be determined by judgment that
our marriage was against God's law, and surely void, then I
shall not only sorrow in departing from so good a lady and
loving companion, but much more lament and bewail my unfortunate
chance, that I have so long lived in adultery, to God's
great displeasure, and have no true heir of my body to inherit
this realm.... Therefore I require of you all to pray with
us that the very truth may be known, for the discharging of our
conscience and the saving of our soul."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> These words, though
wanting in sincerity, were well calculated to soothe men's minds.
Unfortunately, it appears that after this <i>speech from the crown</i>,
the official copy of which has been preserved, Henry added a
few words of his own. "If, however," he said, according to
Du Bellay, casting a threatening glance around him, "there
should be any man whatsoever who speaks of his prince in other
than becoming terms, I will show him that I am the master,
and there is no head so high that I will not roll it from his
shoulders."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> This was a speech in Henry's style; but we cannot
give unlimited credit to Du Bellay's assertions, this diplomatist
being very fond, like others of his class, of "seasoning" his
despatches. But whatever may be the fact as regards the postscript,
the speech on the divorce produced an effect. From that
time there were no more jests, not even on the part of the
Boleyns' enemies. Some supported the king, others were content
to pity the queen in secret; the majority prepared to take
advantage of a court-revolution which every one foresaw. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
king <i>so plainly</i> gave them to understand his pleasure," says the
French ambassador, "that they speak more soberly than they
have done hitherto."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DU BELLAY SOLICITS CAMPEGGIO.</div>

<p>Henry wishing to silence the clamours of the people, and to
allay the fears felt by the higher classes, gave several magnificent
entertainments at one time in London, at another at Greenwich,
now at Hampton Court, and then at Richmond. The queen
accompanied him, but Anne generally remained "in a very
handsome lodging which Henry had furnished for her," says Du
Bellay. The cardinal, following his master's example, gave representations
of French plays with great magnificence. All his
hope was in France. "I desire nothing in England, neither in
word nor in deed, which is not French,"<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> he said to the bishop
of Bayonne. At length Anne Boleyn had accepted the brilliant
position she had at first refused, and every day her stately
mansion (Suffolk House) was filled with a numerous court,&mdash;"more
than ever had crowded to the queen."&mdash;"Yes, yes," said
Du Bellay, as he saw the crowd turning towards the <i>rising sun</i>,
"they wish by these <i>little</i> things to accustom the people to endure
her, that when <i>great</i> ones are attempted, they may not be
found so strange."</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRUE CATHOLICITY.</div>

<p>In the midst of these festivities the grand business did not
slumber. When the French ambassador solicited the subsidy
intended for the ransom of the sons of Francis I, the cardinal
required of him in exchange a paper proving that the marriage
had never been valid. Du Bellay excused himself on the ground
of his age and want of learning; but being given to understand
that he could not have the subsidy without it, he wrote the
memoir in a single day. The enraptured cardinal and king
entreated him to speak with Campeggio.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> The ambassador consented,
and succeeded beyond all expectation. The nuncio, fully
aware that a bow too much bent will break, made Henry by
turns become the sport of hope and fear. "Take care how you
assert that the pope had not the right to grant a dispensation
to the king," said he to the French bishop, "this would be
denying <i>his power, which is infinite</i>. But," added he in a mysterious
tone, "I will point out a road that will infallibly lead
you to the mark. Show that the holy father has been deceived
by false information. <i>Push me hard on that</i>," he continued
"so as to force me to declare that the dispensation was granted
on erroneous grounds."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Thus did the legate himself reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the breach by which the fortress might be surprised. "Victory!"
exclaimed Henry, as he entered Anne's apartments all beaming
with joy.</p>

<p>But this confidence on the part of Campeggio was only a new
trick. "There is a great rumour at court," wrote Du Bellay
soon after, "that the emperor and the king of France are coming
together, and leaving Henry alone, so that all will fall on
his shoulders."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> Wolsey, finding that the intrigues of diplomacy
had failed, thought it his duty to put fresh springs in
motion, "and by all good and honest means to gain the pope's
favour."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> He saw, besides, to his great sorrow, the new catholicity
then forming in the world, and uniting, by the closest
bonds, the Christians of England to those of the continent. To
strike down one of the leaders of this evangelical movement
might incline the court of Rome in Henry's favour. The cardinal
undertook, therefore, to persecute Tyndale; and this resolution
will now transport us to Germany.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">True Catholicity&mdash;Wolsey&mdash;Harman's Matter&mdash;West sent to Cologne&mdash;Labours
of Tyndale and Fryth&mdash;Rincke at Frankfort&mdash;He makes a
Discovery&mdash;Tyndale at Marburg&mdash;West returns to England&mdash;His
Tortures in the Monastery.</p></blockquote>


<p>The residence of Tyndale and his friends in foreign countries,
and the connections there formed with pious Christians,
testify to the fraternal spirit which the Reformation then restored
to the church. It is in protestantism that true catholicity
is to be found. The Romish church is not a catholic
church. Separated from the churches of the east, which are
the oldest in Christendom, and from the reformed churches,
which are the purest, it is nothing but a sect, and that a degenerated
one. A church which should profess to believe in an
episcopal unity, but which kept itself separate from the episcopacy
of Rome and of the East, and from the evangelical
churches, would be no longer a catholic church; it would be a
sect more sectarian still than that of the Vatican, a fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of a fragment. The church of the Saviour requires a truer, a
diviner unity than that of priests, who condemn one another.
It was the reformers, and particularly Tyndale,<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> who proclaimed
throughout Christendom the existence of a <i>body of Christ</i>, of
which all the children of God are members. The disciples of
the Reformation are the true catholics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S CATHOLICITY.</div>

<p>It was a catholicity of another sort that Wolsey desired to
uphold. He did not reject certain reforms in the church, particularly
such as brought him any profit; but, before all, he wished
to preserve for the hierarchy their privileges and uniformity.
The Romish Church in England was then personified in him,
and if he fell, its ruin would be near. His political talents and
multiplied relations with the continent, caused him to discern
more clearly than others the dangers which threatened the
popedom. The publication of the Scriptures of God in English
appeared to some a cloud without importance, which would
soon disappear from the horizon; but to the foreseeing glance of
Wolsey, it betokened a mighty tempest. Besides, he loved not
the fraternal relations then forming between the evangelical
Christians of Great Britain and of other nations. Annoyed by
this spiritual catholicity, he resolved to procure the arrest of
Tyndale, who was its principal organ.</p>

<p>Already had Hackett, Henry's envoy to the Low Countries,
caused the imprisonment of Harman, an Antwerp merchant, one
of the principal supporters of the English reformer. But Hackett
had in vain asked Wolsey for such documents as would
convict him of <i>treason</i> (for the crime of loving the Bible was
not sufficient to procure Harman's condemnation in Brabant);
the envoy had remained without letters from England, and the
last term fixed by the law having expired, Harman and his wife
were liberated after seven months' imprisonment.</p>

<p>And yet Wolsey had not been inactive. The cardinal hoped
to find elsewhere the co-operation which Margaret of Austria
refused. It was Tyndale that he wanted, and everything seemed
to indicate that he was then hidden at Cologne or in its
neighbourhood. Wolsey, recollecting senator Rincke and the
services he had already performed, determined to send to him
one John West, a friar of the Franciscan convent at Greenwich.
West, a somewhat narrow-minded but energetic man, was very
desirous of distinguishing himself, and he had already gained
some notoriety in England among the adversaries of the Reformation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Flattered by his mission, this vain monk immediately
set off for Antwerp, accompanied by another friar, in order to
seize Tyndale, and even Roy, once his colleague at Greenwich,
and against whom he had there ineffectually contended in argument.</p>

<p>While these men were conspiring his ruin, Tyndale composed
several works, got them printed, and sent to England, and prayed
God night and day to enlighten his fellow-countrymen. "Why
do give you give yourself so much trouble," said some of his
friends. "They will burn your books as they have burnt the
Gospel." "They will only do what I expect," replied he, "if
they burn me also." Already he beheld his own burning pile
in the distance; but it was a sight which only served to increase
his zeal. Hidden, like Luther at the Wartburg, not however
in a castle, but in a humble lodging, Tyndale, like the Saxon
reformer, spent his days and nights translating the Bible. But
not having an elector of Saxony to protect him, he was forced
to change his residence from time to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENESIS AND DEUTERONOMY TRANSLATED.</div>

<p>At this epoch, Fryth, who had escaped from the prisons of
Oxford, rejoined Tyndale, and the sweets of friendship softened
the bitterness of their exile. Tyndale having finished the New
Testament, and begun the translation of the Old, the learned
Fryth was of great use to him. The more they studied the
word of God, the more they admired it. In the beginning of
1529, they published the books of Genesis and Deuteronomy,
and addressing their fellow-countrymen, they said: "As thou
readest, think that every syllable pertaineth to thine own self,
and suck out the pith of the Scripture."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Then denying that
visible signs naturally impart grace, as the schoolmen had pretended,
Tyndale maintained that the sacraments are effectual
only when the Holy Ghost sheds his influence upon them. "The
ceremonies of the Law," he wrote, "stood the Israelites in the
same stead as the sacraments do us. We are saved not by the
power of the sacrifice or the deed itself, but by virtue of <i>faith
in the promise</i>, whereof the sacrifice or ceremony was a token
or sign. The Holy Ghost is no dumb God, no God that goeth
a mumming. Wherever the word is proclaimed, this inward
witness worketh. If baptism preach me the washing in Christ's
blood, so doth the Holy Ghost accompany it; and that deed of
preaching through faith doth put away my sins. The ark of
Noah saved them in the water through faith."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE SOUGHT AT FRANKFORT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>The man who dared address England in language so contrary
to the teaching of the middle ages must be imprisoned. John
West, who had been sent with this object, arrived at Antwerp;
Hackett procured for him as interpreter a friar of English descent,
made him assume a secular dress, and gave him "three
pounds" on the cardinal's account; the less attention the embassy
attracted, the more likely it would be to succeed. But
great was West's vexation, on reaching Cologne, to learn that
Rincke was at Frankfort. But that mattered not; the Greenwich
monk could search for Tyndale at Cologne, and desire
Rincke to do the same at Frankfort; thus there would be two
searches instead of one. West procured a "swift" messenger,
(he too was a monk,) and gave him the letter Wolsey had addressed
to Rincke.</p>

<p>It was fair-time at Frankfort, and the city was filled with
merchants and their wares. As soon as Rincke had finished
reading Wolsey's letter, he hastened to the burgomasters, and
required them to confiscate the English translations of the
Scriptures, and, above all, to seize "the heretic who was troubling
England as Luther troubled Germany." "Tyndale and his
friends have not appeared in our fairs since the month of March
1528," replied the magistrates, "and we know not whether
they are dead or alive."</p>

<p>Rincke was not discouraged. John Schoot of Strasburg,
who was said to have printed Tyndale's books, and who cared
less about the works he published than the money he drew
from them, happened to be at Frankfort. "Where is Tyndale?"
Rincke asked him. "I do not know," replied the printer; but
he confessed that he had printed a thousand volumes at the request
of Tyndale and Roy. "Bring them to me," continued
the senator of Cologne&mdash;"If a fair price is paid me, I will give
them up to you." Rincke paid all that was demanded.</p>

<p>Wolsey would now be gratified, for the New Testament annoyed
him almost as much as the divorce; this book, so dangerous
in his eyes, seemed on the point of raising a conflagration
which would infallibly consume the edifice of Roman
traditionalism. Rincke, who participated in his patron's fears,
impatiently opened the volumes made over to him; but there
was a sad mistake, they were not the New Testament, not even
a work of Tyndale's, but one written by William Roy, a changeable
and violent man, whom the reformer had employed for
some time at Hamburg, and who had followed him to Cologne,
but with whom he had soon become disgusted. "I bade him farewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
for our two lives," said Tyndale, "and a day longer." Roy,
on quitting the reformer, had gone to Strasburg, where he boasted
of his relations with him, and had got a satire in that city
printed against Wolsey and the monastic orders, entitled <i>The
Burial of the Mass</i>: this was the book delivered to Rincke. The
monk's sarcastic spirit had exceeded the legitimate bounds of
controversy, and the senator accordingly dared not send the
volumes to England. He did not however discontinue his inquiries,
but searched every place where he thought he could
discover the New Testament, and having seized all the suspected
volumes, set off for Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE AT MARBURG.</div>

<p>Yet he was not satisfied. He wanted Tyndale, and went
about asking every one if they knew where to find him. But
the reformer, whom he was seeking in so many places, and
especially at Frankfort and Cologne, chanced to be residing at
about equal distances from these two towns, so that Rincke,
while travelling from one to the other, might have met him
face to face, as Ahab's messenger met Elijah.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> Tyndale was at
Marburg, whither he had been drawn by several motives.
Prince Philip of Hesse was the great protector of the evangelical
doctrines. The university had attracted attention in the
Reform by the paradoxes of Lambert of Avignon. Here a
young Scotchman named Hamilton, afterwards illustrious as a
martyr, had studied shortly before, and here too the celebrated
printer, John Luft, had his presses. In this city Tyndale and
Fryth had taken up their abode, in September 1528, and, hidden
on the quiet banks of the Lahn, were translating the Old
Testament. If Rincke had searched this place he could not
have failed to discover them. But either he thought not of it,
or was afraid of the terrible landgrave. The direct road by the
Rhine was that which he followed, and Tyndale escaped.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Cologne, Rincke had an immediate interview
with West. Their investigations having failed, they
must have recourse to more vigorous measures. The senator,
therefore, sent the monk back to England, accompanied by his
son Hermann, charging them to tell Wolsey: "To seize Tyndale
we require fuller powers, ratified by the emperor. The traitors
who conspire against the life of the king of England are not
tolerated in the empire, much less Tyndale and all those who
conspire against Christendom. He must be put to death; nothing
but some striking example can check the Lutheran heresy.&mdash;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
as to ourselves," they were told to add, "by the favour
of God there may possibly be an opportunity for his royal highness
and your grace to recompense us."<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Rincke had not forgotten
the subsidy of ten thousand pounds which he had received
from Henry VII for the Turkish war, when he had gone
to London as Maximilian's envoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEST'S ANNOYANCES.</div>

<p>West returned to England sorely vexed that he had failed in
his mission. What would they say at court and in his monastery?
A fresh humiliation was in reserve for him. Roy, whom
West had gone to look for on the banks of the Rhine, had paid
a visit to his mother on the banks of the Thames; and to crown
all, the new doctrines had penetrated into his own convent. The
warden, father Robinson, had embraced them, and night and
day the Greenwich monks read that New Testament which West
had gone to Cologne to burn. The Antwerp friar, who had
accompanied him on his journey, was the only person to whom
he could confide his sorrows; but the Franciscans sent him back
again to the continent, and then amused themselves at poor West's
expense. If he desired to tell of his adventures on the banks
of the Rhine, he was laughed at; if he boasted of the names of
Wolsey and Henry VIII, they jeered him still more. He desired
to speak to Roy's mother, hoping to gain some useful information
from her; this the monks prevented. "It is in my commission,"
he said. They ridiculed him more and more. Robinson,
perceiving that the commission made West assume unbecoming
airs of independence, requested Wolsey to withdraw it;
and West, fancying he was about to be thrown into prison,
exclaimed in alarm: "I am weary of my life!" and conjured a
friend whom he had at court to procure him before Christmas an
<i>obedience</i> under his lordship's hand and seal, enabling him to
leave the monastery; "What you pay him for it," he added,
"I shall see you be reimbursed." Thus did West expiate the
fanatical zeal which had urged him to pursue the translator of
the oracles of God. What became of him, we know not: he is
never heard of more.</p>

<p>At that time Wolsey had other matters to engage him than
this "obedience." While West's complaints were going to
London, those of the king were travelling to Rome. The great
business in the cardinal's eyes was to maintain harmony between
Henry and the church. There was no more thought about investigations
in Germany, and for a time Tyndale was saved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NECESSITY OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>The king and a part of his people still adhered to the popedom,
and so long as these bonds were not broken the word of
God could not have free course. But to induce England to renounce
Rome, there must indeed be powerful motives: and these
were not wanting.</p>

<p>Wolsey had never given such pressing orders to any of Henry's
ambassadors: "The king," he wrote to Da Casale on the
1st of November 1528, "commits this business to your prudence,
dexterity, and fidelity; and I conjure you to employ all
the powers of your genius, and even to surpass them. Be very
sure that you have done nothing and can do nothing that will
be more agreeable to the king, more desirable by me, and more
useful and glorious for you and your family."<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT BETWEEN CHARLES AND HENRY.</div>

<p>Da Casale possessed a tenacity which justified the cardinal's
confidence, and an active excitable mind: trembling at the
thought of seeing Rome lose England, he immediately requested
an audience of Clement VII. "What!" said he to the pope,
"just as it was proposed to go on with the divorce, your nuncio
endeavours to dissuade the king!... There is no hope
that Catherine of Aragon will ever give an heir to the crown.
Holy father, there must be an end of this. Order Campeggio
to place the <i>decretal</i> in his majesty's hands."&mdash;"What say you?"
exclaimed the pope. "I would gladly lose one of my fingers to
recover it again, and you ask me to make it public ...
it would be my ruin."<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> Da Casale insisted: "we have a duty
to perform," he said; "we remind you at this last hour of the
perils threatening the relations which unite Rome and England.
The crisis is at hand. We knock at your door, we cry, we urge,
we entreat, we lay before you the present and future dangers
which threaten the papacy.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>... The world shall know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that the king at least has fulfilled the duty of a devoted son of
the church. If your holiness desires to keep England in St.
Peter's fold, I repeat ... now is the time ... now
is the time."<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> At these words, Da Casale, unable to restrain
his emotion, fell down at the pope's feet, and begged him to
save the church in Great Britain. The pope was moved.
"Rise," said he, with marks of unwonted grief,<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> "I grant you
all that is in my power; I am willing to confirm the judgment
which the legates may think it their duty to pass; but I acquit
myself of all responsibility as to the untold evils which this
matter may bring with it.... If the king, after having
defended the faith and the church, desires to ruin both, on him
alone will rest the responsibility of so great a disaster." Clement
granted nothing. Da Casale withdrew disheartened, and
feeling convinced that the pontiff was about to treat with
Charles V.</p>

<p>Wolsey desired to save the popedom; but the popedom resisted.
Clement VII was about to lose that island which Gregory
the Great had won with such difficulty. The pope was in
the most cruel position. The English envoy had hardly left
the palace before the emperor's ambassador entered breathing
threats. The unhappy pontiff escaped the assaults of Henry
only to be exposed to those of Charles; he was thrown backwards
and forwards like a ball. "I shall assemble a general
council," said the emperor through his ambassador, "and if you
are found to have infringed the canons of the church in any
point, you shall be proceeded against with every rigour. Do
not forget," added his agent in a low tone, "that your birth is
<i>illegitimate</i>, and consequently excludes you from the pontificate."
The timid Clement, imagining that he saw the tiara falling from
his head, swore to refuse Henry every thing. "Alas!" he said
to one of his dearest confidants, "I repent in dust and ashes
that I ever granted this decretal bull. If the king of England
so earnestly desires it to be given him, certainly it cannot be
merely to know its contents. He is but too familiar with them.
It is only to tie my hands in this matter of the divorce; I would
rather die a thousand deaths." Clement, to calm his agitation,
sent one of his ablest gentlemen of the bed-chamber, Francis
Campana, apparently to feed the king with fresh promises, but
in reality to cut the only thread on which Henry's hopes still
hung. "We embrace your majesty," wrote the pope in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
letter given to Campana, "with the paternal love your numerous
merits deserve."<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> Now Campana was sent to England to
burn clandestinely the famous decretal;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> Clement concealed his
blows by an embrace. Rome had granted many divorces not
so well founded as that of Henry VIII; but a very different
matter from a divorce was in question here; the pope, desirous
of upraising in Italy his shattered power, was about to sacrifice
the Tudor, and to prepare the triumph of the Reformation.
Rome was separating herself from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECRET BRIEF OF JULIUS II.</div>

<p>All Clement's fear was, that Campana would arrive too late
to burn the bull; he was soon reassured; a dead calm prevented
the <i>great matter</i> from advancing. Campeggio, who took care to
be in no hurry about his mission, gave himself up, like a skilful
diplomatist, to his worldly tastes; and when he could not, due
respect being had to the state of his legs, indulge in the chase,
of which he was very fond, he passed his time in gambling, to
which he was much addicted. Respectable historians assert
that he indulged in still more illicit pleasures.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> But this could
not last for ever, and the nuncio sought some new means of
delay, which offered itself in the most unexpected manner. One
day an officer of the queen's presented to the Roman legate a
<i>brief</i> of Julius II, bearing the same date as the <i>bull</i> of dispensation,
signed too, like that, by the secretary Sigismond, and in
which the pope expressed himself in such a manner, that Henry's
objections fell of themselves. "The emperor," said Catherine's
messenger, "has discovered this brief among the papers of Puebla,
the Spanish ambassador in England, at the time of the
marriage."&mdash;"It is impossible to go on," said Campeggio to
Wolsey; "all your reasoning is now cut from under you. <i>We
must wait for fresh instructions.</i>" This was the cardinal's conclusion
at every new incident, and the journey from London to
the Vatican being very long (without reckoning the Roman
dilatoriness), the expedient was infallible.</p>

<p>Thus there existed two acts of the same pope, signed on the
same day&mdash;the one secret, the other public, in contradiction to
each other. Henry determined to send a new mission to Rome.
Anne proposed for this embassy one of the most accomplished
gentlemen of the court, her cousin, Sir Francis Bryan. With
him was joined an Italian, Peter Vannes, Henry's Latin secretary.
"You will search all the registers of the time of Julius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
II," said Wolsey to them; "you will study the hand-writing of
secretary Sigismond, and you will attentively examine the ring
of the fisherman used by that pontiff.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>&mdash;Moreover you will inform
the pope that it is proposed to set a certain greyfriar,
named De Angelis, in his place, to whom Charles would give
the <i>spiritual</i> authority, reserving the <i>temporal</i> for himself. You
will manage so that Clement takes alarm at the project, and
you will then offer him a guard of 2000 men to protect him.
You will ask whether, in case the queen should desire to embrace
a religious life, on condition of the king's doing the same,
and Henry should yield to this wish,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> he could have the assurance
that the pope would afterwards release him from his vows.
And, finally, you will inquire whether, in case the queen should
refuse to enter a convent, the pope would permit the king to
have <i>two wives</i>, as we see in the Old Testament."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The idea
which has brought so much reproach on the landgrave of Hesse
was not a new one; the honour of it belongs to a cardinal and
legate of Rome, whatever Bossuet may say. "Lastly," continued
Wolsey, "as the pope is of a timid disposition, you will not
fail to season your remonstrances with threats. You, Peter,
will take him aside and tell him that, as an Italian, having more
at heart than any one the glory of the holy see, it is your duty
to warn him, that if he persists, the king, his realm, and many
other princes, will for ever separate from the papacy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S CONFERENCE WITH DU BELLAY.</div>

<p>It was not on the mind of the pope alone that it was necessary
to act; the rumour that the emperor and the king of
France were treating together disturbed Henry. Wolsey had
vainly tried to sound Du Bellay; these two priests tried craft
against craft. Besides, the Frenchman was not always seasonably
informed by his court, letters taking <i>ten days</i> to come
from Paris to London.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Henry resolved to have a conference
with the ambassador. He began by speaking to him of <i>his
matter</i>, says Du Bellay, "and I promise you," he added, "that
he needs no advocate, he understands the whole business so
well." Henry next touched upon the <i>wrongs</i> of Francis I,
"recalling so many things that the envoy knew not what to
say."&mdash;"I pray you, Master Ambassador," said Henry in conclusion,
"to beg the king, my brother, to give up a little of his
amusements during a year only for the prompt despatch of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
affairs. Warn those whom it concerns." Having given this
spur to the king of France, Henry turned his thoughts towards
Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NON-AUTHENTICITY OF THE BRIEF.</div>

<p>In truth, the fatal brief from Spain tormented him day and
night, and the cardinal tortured his mind to find proofs of its
non-authenticity; if he could do so, he would acquit the papacy
of the charge of duplicity, and accuse the emperor of forgery.
At last he thought he had succeeded. "In the first place," he
said to the king, "the brief has the same date as the bull.
Now, if the errors in the latter had been found out on the day
it was drawn up, it would have been more natural to make
another than to append a brief pointing out the errors. What!
the same pope, the same day, at the petition of the same persons,
give out two rescripts for one effect,<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> one of which contradicts
the other! Either the bull was good, and then, why
the brief? or the bull was bad, and then, why deceive princes
by a worthless bull? Many names are found in the brief incorrectly
spelt, and these are faults which the pontifical secretary,
whose accuracy is so well known, could not have committed.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
Lastly, no one in England ever heard mention of this brief; and
yet it is here that it ought to be found." Henry charged
Knight, his principal secretary, to join the other envoys with all
speed, in order to prove to the pope the supposititious character
of the document.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S TROUBLE.</div>

<p>This important paper revived the irritation felt in England
against Charles V, and it was resolved to come to extremities.
Every one discontented with Austria took refuge in London,
particularly the Hungarians. The ambassador from Hungary
proposed to Wolsey to adjudge the imperial crown of Germany
to the elector of Saxony or the landgrave of Hesse, the two
chiefs of protestantism.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> Wolsey exclaimed in alarm: "It will
be an inconvenience to Christendom, <i>they are so Lutheran</i>." But
the Hungarian ambassador so satisfied him that in the end he
did not find the matter quite so inconvenient. These schemes
were prospering in London, when suddenly a new metamorphosis
took place under the eyes of Du Bellay. The king, the
cardinal, and the ministers appeared in strange consternation.
Vincent da Casale had just arrived from Rome with a letter
from his cousin the prothonatory, informing Henry that the
pope, seeing the triumph of Charles V, the indecision of Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
I, the isolation of the king of England, and the distress of his
cardinal, had flung himself into the arms of the emperor. At
Rome they went so far as to jest about Wolsey, and to say
that since he could not be St. Peter they would make him St.
Paul.</p>

<p>While they were ridiculing Wolsey at Rome, at St. Germain's,
they were joking about Henry. "I will make him get rid of the
notions he has in his head," said Francis; and the Flemings, who
were again sent out of the country, said as they left London,
"that this year they would carry on the war so vigorously, that
it would be really a sight worth seeing."</p>

<p>Besides these public griefs, Wolsey had his private ones.
Anne Boleyn, who had already begun to use her influence on
behalf of the despotic cardinal's victims, gave herself no rest until
Cheyney, a courtier disgraced by Wolsey, had been restored to
the king's favour. Anne even gave utterance to several biting
sarcasms against the cardinal, and the duke of Norfolk and his
party began "to speak big," says Du Bellay. At the moment
when the pope, scared by Charles V, was separating from England,
Wolsey himself was tottering. Who shall uphold the papacy?...
After Wolsey, nobody! Rome was on the point of
losing the power which for nine centuries she had exercised in
the bosom of this illustrious nation. The cardinal's anguish cannot
be described; unceasingly pursued by gloomy images, he saw
Anne on the throne causing the triumph of the Reformation:
this nightmare was stifling him. "His grace, the legate, is in
great trouble," wrote the bishop of Bayonne. "However ...
he is more cunning than they are."<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p>To still the tempest Wolsey had only one resource left: this
was to render Clement favourable to his master's designs. The
crafty Campana, who had burnt the decretal, conjured him not
to believe all the reports transmitted to him concerning Rome.
"To satisfy the king," said he to the cardinal, "the holy father
will, if necessary, descend from the pontifical throne."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Wolsey
therefore resolved to send to Rome a more energetic agent than
Vannes, Bryan, or Knight, and cast his eyes on Gardiner. His
courage began to revive, when an unexpected event fanned once
more his loftiest hopes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S ILLNESS.</div>

<p>On the 6th of January 1529, the feast of Epiphany, just as
the pope was performing mass, he was attacked by a sudden illness;
he was taken to his room, apparently in a dying state.
When this news reached London, the cardinal resolved to hasten
to abandon England, where the soil trembled under his feet, and
to climb boldly to the throne of the pontiffs. Bryan and Vannes,
then at Florence, hurried on to Rome through roads infested
with robbers. At Orvieto they were informed the pope was
better; at Viterbo, no one knew whether he was alive or dead;
at Ronciglione, they were assured that he had expired;
and, finally, when they reached the metropolis of the popedom,
they learnt that Clement could not survive, and that the imperialists,
supported by the Colonnas, were striving to have a
pope devoted to Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PARTIES AMONG THE CARDINALS.</div>

<p>But great as might be the agitation at Rome, it was greater
still at Whitehall. If God caused De' Medici to descend from
the pontifical throne, it could only be, thought Wolsey, to make
him mount it. "It is expedient to have such a pope as may
save the realm," said he to Gardiner. "And although it cannot
but be incommodious to me in this mine old age to be the
common father, yet, when all things be well pondered, the qualities
of all the cardinals well considered, I am the only one, without
boasting, that can and will remedy the king's secret matter. And
were it not for the redintegration of the state of the church, and
especially to relieve the king and his realm from their calamities,
all the riches and honour of the world should not cause me to
accept the said dignity. Nevertheless I conform myself to the necessities
of the times. Wherefore, Master Stephen, that this
matter may succeed, I pray you to apply all your ingenuity,
spare neither money nor labour. I give you the amplest powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
without restriction or limitation."<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> Gardiner departed to win
for his master the coveted tiara.</p>

<p>Henry VIII and Wolsey, who could hardly restrain their impatience,
soon heard of the pontiff's death from different quarters.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
"The emperor has taken away Clement's life,"<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> said
Wolsey, blinded by hatred. "Charles," rejoined the king, "will
endeavour to obtain by force or fraud, a pope according to his
desires." "Yes, to make him his chaplain," replied Wolsey,
"and to put an end by degrees both to pope and popedom."<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>
"We must fly to the defence of the church," resumed Henry,
"and with that view, my lord, make up your mind to be pope."&mdash;"That
alone," answered the cardinal, "can bring your Majesty's
weighty matter to a happy termination, and by saving you, save
the church ... and myself also," he thought in his heart.&mdash;"Let
us see, let us count the voters."</p>

<p>Henry and his minister then wrote down on a strip of parchment
the names of all the cardinals, marking with the letter <i>A</i>
those who were on the side of the kings of England and France,
and with the letter <i>B</i> all who favoured the emperor. "There
was no <i>C</i>," says a chronicler sarcastically, "to signify any on
<i>Christ's</i> side." The letter <i>N</i> designated the neutrals. "The
cardinals present," said Wolsey, "will not exceed thirty-nine,
and we must have two-thirds, that is, twenty-six. Now, there
are twenty upon whom we can reckon; we must therefore, at
any price, gain six of the neutrals."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEANS TO GAIN THE TIARA.</div>

<p>Wolsey, deeply sensible of the importance of an election that
would decide whether England was to be reformed or not, carefully
drew up the instructions, which Henry signed and which
history must register. "We desire and ordain," the ambassadors
were informed in them, "that you secure the election of
the cardinal of York; not forgetting that next to the salvation
of his own soul, there is nothing the king desires more earnestly.</p>

<p>"To gain over the neutral cardinals you will employ two
methods in particular. The first is, the cardinals being present,
and having God and the Holy Ghost before them, you shall remind
them that the cardinal of York alone can save Christendom.</p>

<p>"The second is, because human fragility suffereth not all
things to be pondered and weighed in a just balance, it appertaineth
in matter of so high importance, to the comfort and relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of all Christendom, to succour the infirmity that may chance
... not for corruption, you will understand ... but rather
to help the lacks and defaults of human nature. And, therefore,
it shall be expedient that you promise spiritual offices,
dignities, rewards of money, or other things which shall seem
meet to the purpose.</p>

<p>"Then shall you, with good dexterity, combine and knit those
favourable to us in a perfect fastness and indissoluble knot.
And that they may be the better animated to finish the election
to the king's desire, you shall offer them a guard of 2000 or
3000 men from the kings of England and France, from the viscount
of Turin, and the republic of Venice.</p>

<p>"If, notwithstanding all your exertions, the election should
fail, then the cardinals of the kings shall repair to some sure
place, and there proceed to such an election as may be to God's
pleasure.</p>

<p>"And to win more friends for the king, you shall promise, on
the one hand, to the Cardinal de' Medici and his party our special
favour; and the Florentines, on the other hand, you shall put in
comfort of the exclusion of the said family De' Medici. Likewise
you shall put the cardinals in perfect hope of recovering the
patrimony of the church; and you shall contain the Venetians
in good trust of a reasonable way to be taken for Cervia and
Ravenna (which formed part of the patrimony) to their contentment."<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>Such were the means by which the cardinal hoped to win the
papal throne. To the right he said <i>yes</i>, to the left he said <i>no</i>.
What would it matter that these perfidies were one day discovered,
provided it were after the election. Christendom
might be very certain that the choice of the future pontiff
would be the work of the Holy Ghost. Alexander VI had been
a poisoner; Julius II had given way to ambition, anger, and vice;
the liberal Leo X had passed his life in worldly pursuits; the
unhappy Clement VII had lived on stratagems and lies; Wolsey
would be their worthy successor:</p>

<p class="center">
"All the seven deadly sins have worn the triple crown."<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DIVORCE DEMANDED.</div>

<p>Wolsey found his excuse in the thought, that if he succeeded,
the divorce was secured, and England enslaved for ever to the
court of Rome.</p>

<p>Success at first appeared probable. Many cardinals spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
openly in favour of the English prelate; one of them asked for a
detailed account of his life, in order to present it as a model to
the church; another worshipped him (so he said) as a divinity....
Among the gods and popes adored at Rome there
were some no better than he. But ere long alarming news
reached England. What grief! the pope was getting better.
"Conceal your instructions," wrote the cardinal, "and reserve
them <i>in omnem eventum</i>."</p>

<p>Wolsey not having obtained the tiara, it was necessary at
least to gain the divorce. "God declares," said the English
ambassadors to the pope, "<i>except the Lord build the house, they
labour in vain that build it</i>.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Therefore, the king, taking God
alone for his guide, requests of you, in the first place, an engagement
to pronounce the divorce in the space of three months,
and in the second the avocation to Rome."&mdash;"The promise
first, and only after that the avocation," Wolsey had said; "for
I fear that if the pope begins with the avocation, he will never
pronounce the divorce."&mdash;"Besides," added the envoys, "the
king's second marriage admits of no refusal, whatever bulls or
briefs there may be.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> The only issue of this matter is the
divorce; the divorce in one way or another must be procured."</p>

<p>Wolsey had instructed his envoys to pronounce these words
with a certain air of familiarity, and at the same time with a
gravity calculated to produce an effect.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> His expectations were
deceived: Clement was colder than ever. He had determined
to abandon England in order that he might secure the States
of the Church, of which Charles was then master, thus sacrificing
the spiritual to the temporal. "The pope will not do the
least thing for your majesty," wrote Bryan to the king; "your
matter may well be in his <i>Pater noster</i>, but it certainly is not
in his <i>Credo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> "Increase in importunity," answered the king;
"the cardinal of Verona should remain about the pope's person
and counterbalance the influence of De Angelis and the archbishop
of Capua. I would rather lose my two crowns than
be beaten by these two friars."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S TERGIVERSATIONS.</div>

<p>Thus was the struggle about to become keener than ever,
when Clement's relapse once more threw doubt on every thing.
He was always between life and death; and this perpetual alternation
agitated the king and the impatient cardinal in every way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
The latter considered that the pope had need of <i>merits</i> to enter
the kingdom of heaven. "Procure an interview with the pope,"
he wrote to the envoys, "even though he be in the very agony
of death;<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> and represent to him that nothing will be more likely
<i>to save his soul</i> than the bill of divorce." Henry's commissioners
were not admitted; but towards the end of March, the deputies
appearing in a body,<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> the pope promised to examine the
letter from Spain. Vannes began to fear this document; he represented
that those who had fabricated it would have been
able to give it an appearance of authenticity. "Rather declare
immediately that this brief is not a brief," said he to the pope.
"The king of England, who is your holiness's son, is not so like
the rest of the world. We cannot put the same shoe on every
foot."<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> This rather vulgar argument did not touch Clement.
"If to content your master in this business," said he, "I cannot
employ my head, at least I will my finger."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>&mdash;"Be pleased to
explain yourself," replied Vannes, who found the <i>finger</i> a very
little matter.&mdash;"I mean," resumed the pontiff, "that I shall
employ every means, provided they are <i>honourable</i>." Vannes
withdrew disheartened.</p>

<p>He immediately conferred with his colleagues, and all together,
alarmed at the idea of Henry's anger, returned to the pontiff;
they thrust aside the lackeys, who endeavoured to stop them,
and made their way into his bed-chamber. Clement opposed
them with that resistance of inertia by which the popedom has
gained its greatest victories: <i>siluit</i>, he remained silent. Of
what consequence to the pontiff were Tudor, his island, and his
church, when Charles of Austria was threatening him with his
armies? Clement, less proud than Hildebrand, submitted willingly
to the emperor's power, provided the emperor would protect
him. "I had rather," he said, "be Cæsar's servant, not
only in a temple, but in a stable if necessary, than be exposed
to the insults of rebels and vagabonds."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> At the same time he
wrote to Campeggio: "Do not irritate the king, but spin out
this matter as much as possible;<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> the Spanish brief gives us the
means."</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRATAGEMS AND DELAYS.</div>

<p>In fact, Charles V had twice shown Lee the original document,
and Wolsey, after this ambassador's report, began to believe
that it was not Charles who had forged the brief, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Pope Julius II had really given two contradictory documents
on the same day. Accordingly the cardinal now feared to see
this letter in the pontiff's hands. "Do all you can to dissuade
the pope from seeking the original in Spain," wrote he to one
of his ambassadors; "it may exasperate the emperor." We
know how cautious the cardinal was towards Charles. Intrigue
attained its highest point at this epoch, and Englishmen and
Romans encountered craft with craft. "In such ticklish negotiations,"
says Burnet, (who had had some little experience in
diplomacy) "ministers must say and unsay as they are instructed,
which goes of course as a part of their business."<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> Henry's
envoys to the pope intercepted the letters sent from Rome, and
had Campeggio's seized.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> On his part the pope indulged in
flattering smiles and perfidious equivocations. Bryan wrote to
Henry VIII: "Always your grace hath done for him in deeds,
and he hath recompensed you with fair <i>words</i>, and fair <i>writings</i>,
of which both I think your grace shall lack none; but as for the
<i>deeds</i>, I never believe to see them, and especially at this time."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>
Bryan had comprehended the court of Rome better perhaps than
many politicians. Finally, Clement himself, wishing to prepare
the king for the blow he was about to inflict, wrote to him:
"We have been able to find nothing that would satisfy your
ambassadors."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p>Henry thought he knew what this message meant: that he
had found nothing, and would find nothing; and accordingly
this prince, who, if we may believe Wolsey, had hitherto shown
incredible patience and gentleness,<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> gave way to all his violence.
"Very well then," said he; "my lords and I well know how to
withdraw ourselves from the authority of the Roman see."
Wolsey turned pale, and conjured his master not to rush into
that fearful abyss;<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> Campeggio, too, endeavoured to revive the
king's hopes. But it was all of no use. Henry recalled his
ambassadors.</p>

<p>Henry, it is true, had not yet reached the age when violent
characters become inflexible from the habit they have encouraged
of yielding to their passions. But the cardinal, who knew
his master, knew also that his inflexibility did not depend upon
the number of his years; he thought Rome's power in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
was lost, and placed between Henry and Clement, he exclaimed:
"How shall I avoid Scylla, and not fall into Charybdis?"<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> He
begged the king to make one last effort by sending Dr. Bennet
to the pope with orders to support the avocation to Rome, and
he gave him a letter in which he displayed all the resources of
his eloquence. "How can it be imagined," he wrote, "that
the persuasions of sense urge the king to break a union in which
the ardent years of his youth were passed with such purity?<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>...
The matter is very different. I am on the spot, I
know the state of men's minds.... Pray, believe me....
The divorce is the secondary question; the primary
one is the <i>fidelity of this realm</i> to the papal see. The nobility,
gentry, and citizens all exclaim with indignation: Must our fortunes,
and even our lives, depend upon the nod of a foreigner?
We must abolish, or at the very least diminish, the authority of
the Roman pontiff.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>... Most holy father, we cannot
mention such things without a shudder."... This
new attempt was also unavailing. The pope demanded of
Henry how he could doubt his good will, seeing that the king
of England had done so much for the apostolic see.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> This
appeared a cruel irony to Tudor; the king requested a favour of
the pope, and the pope replied by calling to mind those which
the papacy had received from his hands. "Is this the way,"
men asked in England, "in which Rome pays her debts?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S EARNESTNESS.</div>

<p>Wolsey had not reached the term of his misfortunes.
Gardiner and Bryan had just returned to London: they declared
that to demand an avocation to Rome was to lose their cause.
Accordingly Wolsey, who turned to every wind, ordered Da
Casale, in case Clement should pronounce the avocation, to
appeal from the pope, the false head of the church, <i>to the true
vicar of Jesus Christ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> This was almost in Luther's style. Who
was this true vicar? Probably a pope nominated by the influence
of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S GRIEF.</div>

<p>But this proceeding did not assure the cardinal: he was losing
his judgment. A short time before this Du Bellay, who had
just returned from Paris, whither he had gone to retain France
on the side of England, had been invited to Richmond by Wolsey.
As the two prelates were walking in the park, on that
hill whence the eye ranges over the fertile and undulating fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
through which the winding Thames pours its tranquil waters,
the unhappy cardinal observed to the bishop: "My trouble is
the greatest that ever was!... I have excited and carried
on this matter of the divorce, to dissolve the union between the
two houses of Spain and England, by sowing misunderstanding
between them, as if I had no part in it.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> You know it was in
the interest of France; I therefore entreat the king your master
and her majesty to do every thing that may forward the
divorce. I shall esteem such a favour more than if they made
me pope; but if they refuse me, my ruin is inevitable." And
then giving way to despair, he exclaimed: "Alas! would that
I were going to be buried to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The wretched man was drinking the bitter cup his perfidies
had prepared for him. All seemed to conspire against Henry,
and Bennet was recalled shortly after. It was said at court
and in the city: "Since the pope sacrifices us to the emperor,
let us sacrifice the pope." Clement VII, intimidated by the threats
of Charles V, and tottering upon his throne, madly repelled
with his foot the bark of England. Europe was all attention,
and began to think that the proud vessel of Albion, cutting the
cable that bound her to the pontiffs, would boldly spread her
canvass to the winds, and ever after sail the sea alone, wafted
onwards by the breeze that comes from heaven.</p>

<p>The influence of Rome over Europe is in great measure political.
It loses a kingdom by a royal quarrel, and might in
this same way lose ten.</p>

<p>Other circumstances from day to day rendered the emancipation
of the church more necessary. If behind these political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
debates there had not been found a Christian people, resolved
never to temporize with error, it is probable that England, after
a few years of independence, would have fallen back into the
bosom of Rome. The affair of the divorce was not the only
one agitating men's minds; the religious controversies, which
for some years filled the continent, were always more animated
at Oxford and Cambridge. The <i>Evangelicals</i> and the <i>Catholics</i>
(not very catholic indeed) warmly discussed the great questions
which the progress of events brought before the world. The
former maintained that the primitive church of the apostles and
the actual church of the papacy were not identical; the latter
affirmed, on the contrary, the identity of popery and apostolic
Christianity. Other Romish doctors in later times, finding this
position somewhat embarrassing, have asserted that Catholicism
existed only <i>in the germ</i> in the apostolic church, and had
subsequently developed itself. But a thousand abuses, a thousand
errors may creep into a church under cover of this theory.
A plant springs from the seed and grows up in accordance with
immutable laws; whilst a doctrine cannot be transformed in the
mind of man without falling under the influence of sin. It is
true that the disciples of popery have supposed a constant action
of the Divine Spirit in the Catholic church, which excludes every
influence of error. To stamp on the development of the church
the character of truth, they have stamped on the church itself
the character of infallibility; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>. Their
reasoning is a mere begging of the question. To know whether
the Romish development is identical with the Gospel, we must
examine it by Scripture.</p>

<p>It was not university men alone who occupied themselves
with Christian truth. The separation which has been remarked
in other times between the opinions of the people and of the
learned, did not now exist. What the doctors taught, the
citizens practised; Oxford and London embraced each other.
The theologians knew that learning has need of life, and the
citizens believed that life has need of that learning which derives
the doctrine from the wells of the Scriptures of God. It
was the harmony between these two elements, the one theological,
the other practical, which constituted the strength of the
English reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEWKESBURY BEFORE THE BISHOPS.</div>

<p>The evangelical life in the capital alarmed the clergy more
than the evangelical doctrine in the colleges. Since Monmouth
had escaped, they must strike another. Among the London
merchants was John Tewkesbury, one of the oldest friends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the Scriptures in England. As early as 1512 he had become
possessor of a manuscript copy of the Bible, and had attentively
studied it; when Tyndale's New Testament appeared, he read it
with avidity; and, finally, <i>The Wicked Mammon</i> had completed
the work of his conversion. Being a man of heart and understanding,
clever in all he undertook, a ready and fluent speaker,
and liking to get to the bottom of every thing, Tewkesbury
like Monmouth became very influential in the city, and one of
the most learned in Scripture of any of the evangelicals. These
generous Christians, being determined to consecrate to God the
good things they had received from him, were the first among that
long series of laymen who were destined to be more useful to
the truth than many ministers and bishops. They found time
to interest themselves about the most trifling details of the
kingdom of God; and in the history of the Reformation in Britain
their names should be inscribed beside those of Latimer and
Tyndale.</p>

<p>The activity of these laymen could not escape the cardinal's
notice. Clement VII was abandoning England: it was necessary
for the English bishops, by crushing the heretics, to show that
they would not abandon the popedom. We can understand
the zeal of these prelates, and without excusing their persecutions,
we are disposed to extenuate their crime. The bishops
determined to ruin Tewkesbury. One day in April 1529, as he
was busy among his peltries, the officers entered his warehouse,
arrested him, and led him away to the bishop of London's
chapel, where, besides the ordinary (Tonstall), the bishops of
Ely, St. Asaph, Bath, and Lincoln, with the abbot of Westminster,
were on the bench. The composition of this tribunal
indicated the importance of his case. The emancipation of the
laity, thought these judges, is perhaps a more dangerous heresy
than justification by faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MORE'S ATTACK ON TYNDALE.</div>

<p>"John Tewkesbury," said the bishop of London, "I exhort
you to trust less to your own wit and learning, and more unto
the doctrine of the holy mother the church." Tewkesbury
made answer, that in his judgment he held no other doctrine
than that of the church of Christ. Tonstall then broached the
principal charge, that of having read the Wicked Mammon, and
after quoting several passages, he exclaimed: "Renounce these
errors."&mdash;"I find no fault in the book," replied Tewkesbury.
"It has enlightened my conscience and consoled my heart. But
it is not my Gospel. I have studied the Holy Scriptures these
seventeen years, and as a man sees the spots of his face in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
glass, so by reading them I have learnt the faults of my soul.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
If there is a disagreement between you and the New Testament,
put yourselves in harmony with it, rather than desire to put
that in accord with you." The bishops were surprised that a
leather-seller should speak so well, and quote Scripture so
happily that they were unable to resist him.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> Annoyed at being
catechised by a layman, the bishops of Bath, St. Asaph, and
Lincoln thought they could conquer him more easily by the
rack than by their arguments. He was taken to the Tower,
where they ordered him to be put to the torture. His limbs
were crushed, which was contrary to the laws of England, and
the violence of the rack tore from him a cry of agony to which
the priests replied by a shout of exultation. The inflexible
merchant had promised at last to renounce Tyndale's Wicked
Mammon. Tewkesbury left the Tower "almost a cripple,"<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>
and returned to his house to lament the fatal word which the
question had extorted from him, and to prepare in the silence
of faith to confess in the burning pile the precious name of
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>We must, however, acknowledge that the "question" was not
Rome's only argument. The gospel had two classes of opponents
in the sixteenth century, as in the first ages of the church.
Some attacked it with the torture, others with their writings.
Sir Thomas More, a few years later, was to have recourse to the
first of these arguments; but for the moment he took up his
pen. He had first studied the writings of the Fathers of the
church and of the Reformers, but rather as an advocate than
as a theologian; and then, armed at all points, he rushed into
the arena of polemics, and in his attacks dealt those "technical
convictions and that malevolent subtlety," says one of his greatest
admirers,<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> "from which the honestest men of his profession
are not free." Jests and sarcasms had fallen from his pen in
his discussion with Tyndale, as in his controversy with Luther.
Shortly after Tewkesbury's affair (in June, 1529) there appeared
<i>A Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knt., touching the pestilent
Sect of Luther and Tyndale, by the one begun in Saxony, and by
the other laboured to be brought into England</i>.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A THEOLOGICAL DUEL.</div>

<p>Tyndale soon became informed of More's publication, and a
remarkable combat ensued between these two representatives
of the two doctrines that were destined to divide Christendom&mdash;Tyndale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the champion of Scripture, and More the champion of
the church. More having called his book a <i>dialogue</i>, Tyndale
adopted this form in his reply,<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> and the two combatants valiantly
crossed their swords, though wide seas lay between them.
This theological duel is not without importance in the history
of the Reformation. The struggles of diplomacy, of sacerdotalism,
and of royalty were not enough; there must be struggles
of doctrine. Rome had set the hierarchy above the faith; the
Reformation was to restore faith to its place above the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>In this manner did the catholic and the evangelical carry on
the discussion. According to Tyndale, what constitutes the
true church is the work of the Holy Ghost within; according to
More, the constitution of the papacy without. The spiritual
character of the Gospel is thus put in opposition to the formalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
character of the Roman church. The Reformation restored to
our belief the solid foundation of the word of God; for the sand
it substituted the rock. In the discussion to which we have
just been listening, the advantage remained not with the
catholic. Erasmus, a friend of More's, embarrassed by the
course the latter was taking, wrote to Tonstall: "I cannot
heartily congratulate More."<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></p>

<p>Henry interrupted the celebrated knight in these contests to
send him to Cambray, where a peace was negotiating between
France and the empire. Wolsey would have been pleased to go
himself; but his enemies suggested to the king, "that it was
only that he might not expedite the matter of the divorce."
Henry, therefore, despatched More, Knight, and Tonstall; but
Wolsey had created so many delays that he did not arrive until
after the conclusion of the <i>Ladies' Peace</i> (August 1529). The
king's vexation was extreme. Du Bellay had in vain helped
him to spend a <i>good preparatory July</i> to make him <i>swallow the
dose</i>.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> Henry was angry with Wolsey, Wolsey threw the blame

<div class="sidenote">TREATY AGAINST LUTHERAN BOOKS.</div>

<p>By way of compensation, the English envoys concluded with
the emperor a treaty prohibiting on both sides the printing and
sale of "any Lutheran books."<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> Some of them could have
wished for a good persecution, for a few burning piles, it may
be. A singular opportunity occurred. In the spring of 1529,
Tyndale and Fryth had left Marburg for Antwerp, and were
thus in the vicinity of the English envoys. What West had
been unable to effect, it was thought the two most intelligent
men in Britain could not fail to accomplish. "Tyndale must
be captured," said More and Tonstall.&mdash;"You do not know
what sort of a country you are in," replied Hackett. "Will
you believe that on the 7th of April, Harman arrested me at
Antwerp for damages, caused by his imprisonment? If you can
lay anything to my charge as a private individual, I said to the
officer, I am ready to answer for myself; but if you arrest me
as ambassador, I know no judge but the emperor. Upon which
the procurator had the audacity to reply, that I was arrested <i>as
ambassador</i>; and the lords of Antwerp only set me at liberty on
condition that I should appear again at the first summons.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
These merchants are so proud of their franchises, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
would resist even Charles himself." This anecdote was not at
all calculated to encourage More; and not caring about a pursuit,
which promised to be of little use, he returned to England.
But the bishop of London, who was left behind, persisted in the
project, and repaired to Antwerp to put it in execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE'S DANGER.</div>

<p>Tyndale was at that time greatly embarrassed; considerable
debts, incurred with his printers, compelled him to suspend his
labours. Nor was this all: the prelate who had spurned him so
harshly in London, had just arrived in the very city where he
lay concealed.... What would become of him?... A merchant,
named Augustin Packington, a clever man, but somewhat inclined
to dissimulation, happening to be at Antwerp on business,
hastened to pay his respects to the bishop. The latter observed,
in the course of conversation: "I should like to get hold of the
books with which England is poisoned." "I can perhaps
serve you in that matter," replied the merchant. "I know the
Flemings, who have bought Tyndale's books; so that if your
lordship will be pleased to pay for them, I will make you sure
of them all."&mdash;"Oh, oh!" thought the bishop, "Now, as the
proverb says, I shall have God by the toe.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> Gentle Master
Packington," he added in a flattering tone, "I will pay for them
whatsoever they cost you. I intend to burn them at St. Paul's
cross." The bishop, having his hand already on Tyndale's
Testaments, fancied himself on the point of seizing Tyndale
himself.</p>

<p>Packington, being one of those men who love to conciliate
all parties, ran off to Tyndale, with whom he was intimate, and
said:&mdash;"William, I know you are a poor man, and have a heap
of New Testaments and books by you, for which you have
beggared yourself; and I have now found a merchant who will
buy them all, and with ready money too."&mdash;"Who is the merchant?"
said Tyndale.&mdash;"The bishop of London."&mdash;"Tonstall?...
If he buys my books, it can only be to burn them."&mdash;"No
doubt," answered Packington; "but what will he gain by it? The
whole world will cry out against the priest who burns God's word,
and the eyes of many will be opened. Come, make up your
mind, William; the bishop shall have the books, you the money,
and I the thanks."... Tyndale resisted the proposal; Packington
became more pressing. "The question comes to this,"
he said; "shall the bishop pay for the books or shall he not?
for, make up your mind ... he will have them."&mdash;"I consent,"
said the Reformer at last; "I shall pay my debts, and bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
out a new and more correct edition of the Testament." The
bargain was made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE SHIPWRECKED.</div>

<p>Erelong the danger thickened around Tyndale. Placards,
posted at Antwerp and throughout the province, announced that
the emperor, in conformity with the treaty of Cambray, was
about to proceed against the Reformers and their writings.
Not an officer of justice appeared in the street but Tyndale's
friends trembled for his liberty. Under such circumstances,
how could he print his translation of Genesis and Deuteronomy?
He made up his mind about the end of August to go to Hamburg,
and take his passage in a vessel loading for that port. Embarking
with his books, his manuscripts, and the rest of his
money, he glided down the Scheldt, and soon found himself
afloat on the German ocean.</p>

<p>But one danger followed close upon another. He had
scarcely passed the mouth of the Meuse when a tempest burst
upon him, and his ship, like that of old which bore St. Paul,
was almost swallowed up by the waves.&mdash;"Satan, envying the
happy course and success of the Gospel," says a chronicler, "set
to his might how to hinder the blessed labours of this man."<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
The seamen toiled, Tyndale prayed, all hope was lost. The
reformer alone was full of courage, not doubting that God
would preserve him for the accomplishment of his work. All
the exertions of the crew proved useless; the vessel was dashed
on the coast, and the passengers escaped with their lives. Tyndale
gazed with sorrow upon that ocean which had swallowed
up his beloved books and precious manuscripts, and deprived
him of his resources.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> What labours, what perils! banishment,
poverty, thirst, insults, watchings, persecution, imprisonment,
the stake!... Like Paul, he was in perils by his own countrymen,
in perils among strange people, in perils in the city, in
perils in the sea. Recovering his spirits, however, he went on
board another ship, entered the Elbe, and at last reached Hamburg.</p>

<p>Great joy was in store for him in that city. Coverdale,
Foxe informs us, was waiting there to confer with him, and to
help him in his labours.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> It has been supposed that Coverdale
went to Hamburg to invite Tyndale, in Cromwell's name, to return
to England;<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> but it is merely a conjecture, and requires
confirmation. As early as 1527, Coverdale had made known
to Cromwell his desire to translate the Scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
natural that, meeting with difficulties in this undertaking, he
should desire to converse with Tyndale. The two friends lodged
with a pious woman named Margaret van Emmersen, and spent
some time together in the autumn of 1529, undisturbed by the
sweating sickness which was making such cruel havoc all around
them. Coverdale returned to England shortly after; the two reformers
had, no doubt, discovered that it was better for each of
them to translate the Scriptures separately.</p>

<p>Before Coverdale's return, Tonstall had gone back to London,
exulting at carrying with him the books he had bought so dearly.
But when he reached the capital, he thought he had better
defer the meditated <i>auto da fé</i> until some striking event should
give it increased importance. And besides, just at that moment,
very different matters were engaging public attention on the
banks of the Thames, and the liveliest emotions agitated every
mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL SESSION.</div>

<p>Affairs had changed in England during the absence of Tonstall
and More; and even before their departure, events of a
certain importance had occurred. Henry, finding there was
nothing more to hope from Rome, had turned to Wolsey and
Campeggio. The Roman nuncio had succeeded in deceiving the
king. "Campeggio is very different from what he is reported,"
said Henry to his friends; "he is not for the emperor, as I was
told; I have said somewhat to him which has changed his mind."<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>
No doubt he had made some brilliant promise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COMMISSION OPENED.</div>

<p>Henry therefore, imagining himself sure of his two legates,
desired them to proceed with the matter of the divorce without
delay. There was no time to lose, for the king was informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
that the pope was on the point of recalling the commission
given to the two cardinals; and as early as the 19th of March,
Salviati, the pope's uncle and secretary of state, wrote to Campeggio
about it.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> Henry's process, once in the court of the pontifical
chancery, it would have been long before it got out again.
Accordingly, on the 31st of May, the king, by a warrant under
the great seal, gave the legates <i>leave</i> to execute their commission,
"without any regard to his own person, and having the fear of
God only before their eyes."<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> The legates themselves had suggested
this formula to the king.</p>

<p>On the same day the commission was opened; but to begin the
process was not to end it. Every letter which the nuncio received
forbade him to do so in the most positive manner. "Advance
slowly and never finish," were Clement's instructions.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>
The trial was to be a farce, played by a pope and two cardinals.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical court met in the great hall of the Blackfriars,
commonly called the "parliament chamber." The two
legates having successively taken the commission in their hands,
devoutly declared that they were resolved to execute it (they
should have said, to elude it), made the required oaths, and ordered
a peremptory citation of the king and queen to appear on
the 18th of June at nine in the morning. Campeggio was
eager to proceed <i>slowly</i>; the session was adjourned for three
weeks. The citation caused a great stir among the people.
"What!" said they, "a king and a queen constrained to appear,
in their own realm, before their own subjects." The papacy set
an example which was to be strictly followed in after-years both
in England and in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROYAL SITTING.</div>

<p>On the 18th of June Catherine appeared before the commission
in the parliament chamber, and stepping forward with
dignity, said with a firm voice: "I protest against the legates as
incompetent judges, and appeal to the pope."<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> This proceeding
of the queen's, her pride and firmness, troubled her enemies, and
in their vexation they grew exasperated against her. "Instead
of praying God to bring this matter to a good conclusion," they
said, "she endeavours to turn away the people's affections from
the king. Instead of showing Henry the love of a youthful
wife, she keeps away from him night and day. There is even
cause to fear," they added, "that she is in concert with certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
individuals who have formed the horrible design of killing the
king and the cardinal."<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> But persons of generous heart, seeing
only a queen, a wife, and a mother, attacked in her dearest
affections, showed themselves full of sympathy for her.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, the day to which the court adjourned,
the two legates entered the parliament chamber with all the
pomp belonging to their station, and took their seats on a raised
platform. Near them sat the bishops of Bath and Lincoln,
the abbot of Westminster, and Doctor Taylor, master of the
Rolls, whom they had added to their commission. Below them
were the secretaries, among whom the skilful Stephen Gardiner
held the chief rank. On the right hung a cloth of estate where
the king sat surrounded by his officers; and on the left, a little
lower, was the queen, attended by her ladies. The archbishop
of Canterbury and the bishops were seated between the legates
and Henry VIII, and on both sides of the throne were stationed
the counsellors of the king and queen. The latter were Fisher,
bishop of Rochester, Standish of St. Asaph, West of Ely, and
Doctor Ridley. The people, when they saw this procession defile
before them, were far from being dazzled by the pomp.
"Less show and more virtue," they said, "would better become
such judges."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN'S APPEAL TO THE KING.</div>

<p>The pontifical commission having been read, the legates declared
that they would judge without fear or favour, and would
admit of neither recusation nor appeal.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Then the usher cried:
"Henry, king of England, come into court." The king, cited
in his own capital to accept as judges two priests, his subjects,
repressed the throbbing of his proud heart, and replied, in the
hope that this strange trial would have a favourable issue:
"Here I am." The usher continued: "Catherine, queen of England,
come into court." The queen handed the cardinals a
paper in which she protested against the legality of the court,
as the judges were the subjects of her opponent,<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> and appealed
to Rome. The cardinals declared they could not admit this
paper, and consequently Catherine was again called into court.
At this second summons she rose, devoutly crossed herself, made
the circuit of the court to where the king sat, bending with
dignity as she passed in front of the legates, and fell on her
knees before her husband. Every eye was turned upon her.
Then speaking in English, but with a Spanish accent, which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
recalling the distance she was from her native home, pleaded
eloquently for her, Catherine said with tears in her eyes, and in
a tone at once dignified and impassioned:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beseech you, for all the love that hath been between
us, and for the love of God, let me have justice and right; take
some pity on me, for I am a poor woman and a stranger, born
out of your dominions. I have here no assured friend, much
less impartial counsel, and I flee to you as to the head of justice
within this realm. Alas! Sir, wherein have I offended you, or
what occasion given you of displeasure, that you should wish to
put me from you? I take God and all the world to witness,
that I have been to you a true, humble, and obedient wife, ever
conformable to your will and pleasure. Never have I said or
done aught contrary thereto, being always well pleased and content
with all things wherein you had delight; neither did I ever
grudge in word or countenance, or show a visage or spark of
discontent. I loved all those whom you loved, only for your
sake. This twenty years I have been your true wife, and by
me ye have had divers children, although it hath pleased God to
call them out of this world, which yet hath been no default in
me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN WITHDRAWS.</div>

<p>The judges, and even the most servile of the courtiers, were
touched when they heard these simple and eloquent words, and
the queen's sorrow moved them almost to tears. Catherine continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When ye married me at the first, I take God to be
my judge I was a true maid; and whether it be true or not, I
put it to your conscience.... If there be any just cause that
ye can allege against me, I am contented to depart from your
kingdom, albeit to my great shame and dishonour; and if there
be none, then let me remain in my former estate until death.
Who united us? The king, your father, who was called the
second Solomon; and my father, Ferdinand, who was esteemed one
of the wisest princes that, for many years before, had reigned
in Spain. It is not, therefore, to be doubted that the marriage
between you and me is good and lawful. Who are my judges?
Is not one the man that has put sorrow between you and me?<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>...
a judge whom I refuse and abhor!&mdash;Who are the councillors
assigned me? Are they not officers of the crown, who
have made oath to you in your own council?... Sir, I conjure
you not to call me before a court so formed. Yet, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
refuse me this favour ... your will be done.... I shall be
silent, I shall repress the emotions of my soul, and remit my
just cause to the hands of God."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Catherine through her tears;<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> humbly bending,
she seemed to embrace Henry's knees. She rose and made a
low obeisance to the king. It was expected that she would
return to her seat; but leaning on the arm of Griffiths, her receiver-general,
she moved towards the door. The king, observing
this, ordered her to be recalled; and the usher following
her, thrice cried aloud: "Catherine, queen of England, come
into court."&mdash;"Madam," said Griffiths, "you are called back."&mdash;"I
hear it well enough," replied the queen, "but go you on,
for this is no court wherein I can have justice: let us proceed."
Catherine returned to the palace, and never again appeared before
the court either by proxy or in person.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>She had gained her cause in the minds of many. The dignity
of her person, the quaint simplicity of her speech, the propriety
with which, relying upon her innocence, she had spoken of the
most delicate subjects, and the tears which betrayed her emotion,
had created a deep impression. But "the sting in her speech,"
as an historian says,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> was her appeal to the king's conscience,
and to the judgment of Almighty God, on the capital point in
the cause. "How could a person so modest, so sober in her
language," said many, "dare utter such a falsehood? Besides,
the king did not contradict her."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY JUSTIFIES HIMSELF.</div>

<p>Henry was greatly embarrassed: Catherine's words had moved
him. Catherine's defence, one of the most touching in history,
had gained over the accuser himself. He therefore felt constrained
to render this testimony to the accused: "Since the
queen has withdrawn, I will, in her absence, declare to you all
present, that she has been to me as true and obedient a wife as
I could desire. She has all the virtues and good qualities
that belong to a woman. She is as noble in character as in
birth."</p>

<p>But Wolsey was the most embarrassed of all. When the
queen had said, without naming him, that one of her judges was
the cause of all her misfortunes, looks of indignation were
turned upon him.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> He was unwilling to remain under the
weight of this accusation. As soon as the king had finished
speaking, he said: "Sir, I humbly beg your majesty to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
before this audience, whether I was the first or chief mover in
this business." Wolsey had formerly boasted to Du Bellay,
"that the first project of the divorce was set on foot by himself,
to create a perpetual separation between the houses of England
and Spain;"<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> but now it suited him to affirm the contrary. The
king, who needed his services, took care not to contradict him.
"My lord cardinal," he said, "I can well excuse you herein.
Marry, so far from being a mover, ye have been rather against
me in attempting thereof. It was the bishop of Tarbes, the
French ambassador, who begot the first scruples in my conscience
by his doubts on the legitimacy of the princess Mary."
This was not correct. The bishop of Tarbes was not in England
before the year 1527, and we have proofs that the king
was meditating a divorce in 1526.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> "From that hour," he
continued, "I was much troubled, and thought myself in danger
of God's heavy displeasure, who, wishing to punish my incestuous
marriage, had taken away all the sons my wife had borne
me. I laid my grief before you, my lord of Lincoln, then being
my ghostly father; and by your advice I asked counsel of the
rest of the bishops, and you all informed me under your seals,
that you shared in my scruples."&mdash;"That is the truth," said the
archbishop of Canterbury.&mdash;"No, Sir, not so, under correction,"
quoth the bishop of Rochester, "you have not my hand and
seal."&mdash;"No?" exclaimed the king, showing him a paper which
he held in his hand; "is not this your hand and seal?"&mdash;"No,
forsooth," he answered. Henry's surprise increased, and turning
with a frown to the archbishop of Canterbury, he asked
him: "What say you to that?" "Sir, it is his hand and seal,"
replied Warham.&mdash;"It is not," rejoined Rochester; "I told you
I would never consent to any such act."&mdash;"You say the truth,"
responded the archbishop, "but you were fully resolved at the
last, that I should subscribe your name and put your seal."&mdash;"All
which is untrue," added Rochester, in a passion. The
bishop was not very respectful to his primate. "Well, well,"
said the king, wishing to end the dispute, "we will not stand in
argument with you; for you are but one man."<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> The court
adjourned. The day had been better for Catherine than for the
prelates.</p>

<p>In proportion as the first sitting had been pathetic, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
discussions in the second between the lawyers and bishops were
calculated to revolt a delicate mind. The advocates of the two
parties vigorously debated pro and con respecting the consummation
of Arthur's marriage with Catherine. "It is a very
difficult question," said one of the counsel; "none can know the
truth."&mdash;"But I know it," replied the bishop of Rochester.&mdash;"What
do you mean?" asked Wolsey.&mdash;"My lord," he answered,
"he was the very Truth who said: '<i>What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder</i>' that is enough for me."&mdash;"So
everybody thinks," rejoined Wolsey; "but whether it was God
who united Henry of England and Catherine of Aragon, <i>hoc restat
probandum</i>, that remains to be proved. The king's council
decides that the marriage is unlawful, and consequently it was
not <i>God who joined them together</i>." The two bishops then exchanged
a few words less edifying than those of the preceding
day. Several of the hearers expressed a sentiment of disgust.
"It is a disgrace to the court," said Doctor Ridley with no little
indignation, "that you dare discuss questions which fill every
right-minded man with horror." This sharp reprimand put an
end to the debate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MESSAGE OF THE MAID OF KENT.</div>

<p>The agitations of the court spread to the convents; priests,
monks, and nuns were every where in commotion. It was not
long before astonishing revelations began to circulate through
the cloisters. There was no talk then of an old portrait of the
Virgin that winked its eyes; but other miracles were invented.
"An angel," it was rumoured, "has appeared to Elizabeth Barton,
the maid of Kent, as he did formerly to Adam, to the
patriarchs, and to Jesus Christ." At the epochs of the creation
and of the redemption, and in the times which lead from one
to the other, miracles are natural; God then appeared, and his
coming without any signs of power, would be as surprising as
the rising of the sun unattended by its rays of light. But the
Romish Church does not stop there; it claims in every age, for
its saints, the privilege of miraculous powers, and the miracles
are multiplied in proportion to the ignorance of the people. And
accordingly the angel said to the epileptic maid of Kent: "Go
to the unfaithful king of England, and tell him there are three
things he desires, which I forbid now and for ever. The first
is the power of the pope; the second the new doctrine; the third
Anne Boleyn. If he takes her for his wife, God will visit him."
The vision-seeing maid delivered the message to the king,<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> whom
nothing could now stop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HOT DAY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>On the contrary, he began to find out that Wolsey proceeded
too slowly, and the idea sometimes crossed his mind that he
was betrayed by this minister. One fine summer's morning,
Henry as soon as he rose summoned the cardinal to him at
Bridewell. Wolsey hastened thither, and remained closeted
with the king from eleven till twelve. The latter gave way to
all the fury of his passion and the violence of his despotism.
"We must finish this matter promptly," he said, "we must positively."
Wolsey retired very uneasy, and returned by the
Thames to Westminster. The sun darted his bright rays on the
water. The bishop of Carlisle, who sat by the cardinal's side,
remarked, as he wiped his forehead: "A very warm day, my
lord."&mdash;"Yes," replied the unhappy Wolsey, "if you had been
<i>chafed</i> for an hour as I have been, you would say it was a <i>hot</i>
day." When he reached his palace, the cardinal lay down on
his bed to seek repose; he was not quiet long.</p>

<p>Catherine had grown in Henry's eyes, as well as in those of
the nation. The king shrank from a judgment; he even began
to doubt of his success. He wished that the queen would consent
to a separation. This idea occurred to his mind after
Wolsey's departure, and the cardinal had hardly closed his eyes
before the Earl of Wiltshire (Anne Boleyn's father) was announced
to him with a message from the king. "It is his
majesty's pleasure," said Wiltshire, "that you represent to the
queen the shame that will accrue to her from a judicial condemnation,
and persuade her to confide in his wisdom." Wolsey,
commissioned to execute a task he knew to be impossible,
exclaimed: "Why do you put such fancies in the king's head?"
and then he spoke so reproachfully that Wiltshire, with tears in
his eyes, fell on his knees beside the cardinal's bed.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Boleyn,
desirous of seeing his daughter queen of England, feared perhaps
that he had taken a wrong course. "It is well," said the cardinal,
recollecting that the message came from Henry VIII,
"I am ready to do every thing to please his majesty." He rose,
went to Bath-Place to fetch Campeggio, and together they
waited on the queen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEGATES VISIT THE QUEEN.</div>

<p>The two legates found Catherine quietly at work with her
maids of honour. Wolsey addressed the queen in Latin: "Nay,
my lord," she said, "speak to me in English; I wish all the
world could hear you."&mdash;"We desire, madam, to communicate
to <i>you alone</i> our counsel and opinion."&mdash;"My lord," said the
queen, "you are come to speak of things beyond my capacity;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
and then, with noble simplicity, showing a skein of red silk
hanging about her neck, she continued: "These are my occupations,
and all that I am capable of. I am a poor woman, without
friends in this foreign country, and lacking wit to answer
persons of wisdom as ye be; and yet, my lords, to please you,
let us go to my withdrawing room."</p>

<p>At these words the queen rose, and Wolsey gave her his hand.
Catherine earnestly maintained her rights as a woman and a
queen. "We who were in the outer chamber," says Cavendish,
"from time to time could hear the queen speaking very loud,
but could not understand what she said." Catherine, instead of
justifying herself, boldly accused her judge. "I know, Sir Cardinal,"
she said with noble candour, "I know who has given the
king the advice he is following: it is you. I have not ministered
to your pride&mdash;I have blamed your conduct&mdash;I have complained
of your tyranny, and my nephew the emperor has not made
you pope.... Hence all my misfortunes. To revenge
yourself you have kindled a war in Europe, and have stirred
up against me this most wicked matter. God will be my judge.... and
yours!" Wolsey would have replied, but Catherine
haughtily refused to hear him, and while treating Campeggio
with great civility, declared that she would not acknowledge
either of them as her judge. The cardinals withdrew,
Wolsey full of vexation, and Campeggio beaming with joy, for
the business was getting more complicated. Every hope of
accommodation was lost: nothing remained now but to proceed
judicially.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRIAL RESUMED.</div>

<p>The trial was resumed. The bishop of Bath and Wells waited
upon the queen at Greenwich, and peremptorily summoned her
to appear in the parliament-chamber.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> On the day appointed
Catherine limited herself to sending an appeal to the pope. She
was declared contumacious, and the legates proceeded with
the cause.</p>

<p>Twelve articles were prepared, which were to serve for the
examination of the witnesses, and the summary of which was,
that the marriage of Henry with Catherine, being forbidden
both by the law of God and of the church, was null and
void.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>The hearing of the witnesses began, and Dr. Taylor, archdeacon
of Buckingham, conducted the examination. Their evidence,
which would now be taken only with closed doors, may
be found in Lord Herbert of Cherbury's History of Henry VIII.
The duke of Norfolk, high-treasurer of England, the duke of Suffolk,
Maurice St. John, gentleman-carver to Prince Arthur, the
Viscount Fitzwalter and Anthony Willoughby, his cup-bearers,
testified to their being present on the morrow of the wedding at
the breakfast of the prince, then in sound health, and reported
the conversation that took place.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> The old duchess of Norfolk,
the earl of Shrewsbury, and the marquis of Dorset, confirmed
these declarations, which proved that Arthur and Catherine
were really married. It was also called to mind that, at the
time of Arthur's death, Henry was not permitted to take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>title of prince of Wales, because Catherine hoped to give an heir
to the crown of England.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SECONDARY ARGUMENTS.</div>

<p>"If Arthur and Catherine were really married," said the
king's counsellors after these extraordinary depositions, "the
marriage of this princess with Henry, Arthur's brother, was
forbidden by the divine law, by an express command of God
contained in Leviticus, and no dispensation could permit what
God had forbidden." Campeggio would never concede this argument,
which limited the right of the popes; it was necessary
therefore to abandon the <i>divine right</i> (which was in reality to
lose the cause), and to seek in the bull of Julius II and in his
famous brief for flaws that would invalidate them both;<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> and
this the king's counsel did, although they did not conceal the
weakness of their position. "The motive alleged in the dispensation,"
they said, "is the necessity of preserving a cordial relation
between Spain and England; now, there was nothing that
threatened their harmony. Moreover, it is said in this document
that the pope grants it at the prayer of Henry, prince of
Wales. Now as this prince was only thirteen years old, he was
not of age to make such a request. As for the brief, it is found
neither in England nor in Rome; we cannot therefore admit its
authenticity." It was not difficult for Catherine's friends to
invalidate these objections. "Besides," they added, "a union
that has lasted twenty years, sufficiently establishes its own lawfulness.
And will you declare the Princess Mary illegitimate,
to the great injury of this realm?"</p>

<p>The king's advocates then changed their course. Was not
the Roman legate provided with a decretal pronouncing the
divorce, in case it should be proved that Arthur's marriage had
been really consummated? Now, this fact had been proved by
the depositions. "This is the moment for delivering judgment,"
said Henry and his counsellors to Campeggio. "Publish the
pope's decretal." But the pope feared the sword of Charles V,
then hanging over his head; and accordingly, whenever the king
advanced one step, the Romish prelate took several in an opposite
direction. "I will deliver judgment in <i>five</i> days," said he;
and when the five days were expired, he bound himself to deliver
it in six. "Restore peace to my troubled conscience,"
exclaimed Henry. The legate replied in courtly phrase; he had
gained a few days' delay, and that was all he desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFERENT OPINIONS.</div>

<p>Such conduct on the part of the Roman legate produced an
unfavourable effect in England, and a change took place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
public mind. The first movement had been for Catherine; the
second was for Henry. Clement's endless delays and Campeggio's
stratagems exasperated the nation. The king's argument was
simple and popular: "The pope cannot dispense with the laws
of God;" while the queen, by appealing to the authority of the
Roman pontiff, displeased both high and low. "No precedent,"
said the lawyers, "can justify the king's marriage with his
brother's widow."</p>

<p>There were, however, some evangelical Christians who thought
Henry was "troubled" more by his passions than by his conscience;
and they asked how it happened that a prince, who represented
himself to be so disturbed by the possible transgression
of a law of doubtful interpretation, could desire, after
twenty years, to violate the indisputable law which forbade the
divorce?... On the 21st of July, the day fixed <i>ad
concludendum</i>, the cause was adjourned until the Friday following,
and no one doubted that the matter would then be terminated.</p>

<p>All prepared for this important day. The king ordered the
dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk to be present at the sitting of the
court; and being himself impatient to hear the so much coveted
judgment, he stole into a gallery of the parliament-chamber
facing the judges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEGATE'S REASONS.</div>

<p>The legates of the holy see having taken their seats, the
attorney-general signified to them, "that every thing necessary
for the information of their conscience having been judicially
laid before them, that day had been fixed for the conclusion
of the trial." There was a pause; everyone feeling the importance
of this judgment, waited for it with impatience. "Either
the papacy pronounces my divorce from Catherine," the king
had said, "or I shall divorce myself from the papacy." That
was the way Henry put the question. All eyes, and particularly
the king's, were turned on the judges; Campeggio could
not retreat; he must now say <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>. For some time he was
silent. He knew for certain that the queen's appeal had been
admitted by Clement VII and that the latter had concluded an
alliance with the emperor. It was no longer in his power to
grant the king's request. Clearly foreseeing that a <i>no</i> would
perhaps forfeit the power of Rome in England, while a <i>yes</i> might
put an end to the plans of religious emancipation which alarmed
him so much, he could not make up his mind to say either <i>yes</i>
or <i>no</i>.</p>

<p>At last the nuncio rose slowly from his chair, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
assembly listened with emotion to the oracular decision which
for so many years the powerful king of England had sought
from the Roman pontiff. "The general vacation of the harvest
and vintage," he said, "being observed every year by the court
of Rome, dating from to-morrow the 24th of July, the beginning
of the dog-days, we adjourn, to some future period, the
conclusion of these pleadings."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>The auditors were thunderstruck. "What! because the
<i>malaria</i> renders the air of Rome dangerous at the end of July;
and compels the Romans to close their courts, must a trial be
broken off on the banks of the Thames, when its conclusion is
looked for so impatiently?" The people hoped for a judicial
sentence, and they were answered with a jest; it was thus Rome
made sport of Christendom. Campeggio, to disarm Henry's
wrath, gave utterance to some noble sentiments; but his whole
line of conduct raises legitimate doubts as to his sincerity.
"The queen," he said, "denies the competency of the court; I
must therefore make my report to the pope, who is the source
of life and honour, and wait his sovereign orders. I have not
come so far to please any man, be he king or subject. I am
an old man, feeble and sickly, and fear none but the Supreme
Judge, before whom I must soon appear. I therefore adjourn
this court until the 1st of October."</p>

<p>It was evident that this adjournment was only a formality
intended to signify the definitive rejection of Henry's demand.
The same custom prevails in the British legislature.</p>

<p>The king, who from his place of concealment had heard
Campeggio's speech, could scarcely control his indignation.
He wanted a regular judgment; he clung to forms; he desired
that his cause should pass successfully through all the windings
of ecclesiastical procedure, and yet here it is wrecked upon the
vacations of the Romish court. Henry was silent, however,
either from prudence, or because surprise deprived him of the
power of speech, and he hastily left the gallery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUFFOLK'S VIOLENCE.</div>

<p>Norfolk, Suffolk, and the other courtiers, did not follow him.
The king and his ministers, the peers and the people, and
even the clergy, were almost unanimous, and yet the pope pronounced
his <i>veto</i>. He humbled the Defender of the Faith to
flatter the author of the sack of Rome. This was too much.
The impetuous Suffolk started from his seat, struck his hand
violently on the table in front of him, cast a threatening look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
upon the judges and exclaimed: "By the mass, the old saying
is confirmed to-day, that no cardinal has ever brought good to
England."<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>&mdash;"Sir, of all men in this realm," replied Wolsey,
"you have the least cause to disparage cardinals, for if I, poor
cardinal, had not been, you would not have had a head on your
shoulders."<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> It would seem that Wolsey pacified Henry, at
the time of the duke's marriage with the Princess Mary. "I
cannot pronounce sentence," continued Wolsey, "without knowing
the good pleasure of his holiness." The two dukes and the
other noblemen left the hall in anger, and hastened to the
palace.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> The legates, remaining with their officers, looked at
each other for a few moments. At last Campeggio, who alone
had remained calm during this scene of violence, arose, and the
audience dispersed.</p>

<p>Henry did not allow himself to be crushed by this blow.
Rome, by her strange proceedings, aroused in him that suspicious
and despotic spirit, of which he gave such tragic proofs in after-years.
The papacy was making sport of him. Clement and
Wolsey tossed his divorce from one to the other like a ball
which, now at Rome and now at London, seemed fated to remain
perpetually in the air. The king thought he had been
long enough the plaything of his holiness and of the crafty cardinal;
his patience was exhausted, and he resolved to show his
adversaries that Henry VIII was more than a match for these
bishops. We shall find him seizing this favourable opportunity,
and giving an unexpected solution to the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY ACCUSED BY ALL.</div>

<p>Wolsey sorrowfully hung his head; by taking part with the
nuncio and the pope, he had signed the warrant of his own destruction.
So long as Henry had a single ray of hope, he
thought proper still to dissemble with Clement VII; but he
might vent all his anger on Wolsey. From the period of the
<i>Roman Vacations</i> the cardinal was ruined in his master's mind.
Wolsey's enemies seeing his favour decline, hastened to attack
him. Suffolk and Norfolk in particular, impatient to get rid of
an insolent priest who had so long chafed their pride, told Henry
that Wolsey had been continually playing false; they went over
all his negotiations month by month and day by day, and drew
the most overwhelming conclusions from them. Sir William
Kingston and Lord Manners laid before the king one of the
cardinal's letters which Sir Francis Bryan had obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the papal archives. In it the cardinal desired Clement to spin
out the divorce question, and finally to oppose it, seeing (he
added) that if Henry was separated from Catherine, a friend to
the reformers would become queen of England.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> This letter
clearly expressed Wolsey's inmost thoughts: Rome at any
price ... and perish England and Henry rather than
the popedom! We can imagine the king's anger.</p>

<p>Anne Boleyn's friends were not working alone. There was
not a person at court whom Wolsey's haughtiness and tyranny
had not offended; no one in the king's council in whom his continual
intrigues had not raised serious suspicions. He had (they
said) betrayed in France the cause of England; kept up in time
of peace and war secret intelligence with Madam, mother of
Francis I; received great presents from her;<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> oppressed the
nation, and trodden under foot the laws of the kingdom. The
people called him <i>Frenchman</i> and <i>traitor</i>, and all England
seemed to vie in throwing burning brands at the superb edifice
which the pride of this prelate had so laboriously erected.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<p>Wolsey was too clearsighted not to discern the signs of his
approaching fall. "Both the rising and the setting sun (for
thus an historian calls Anne Boleyn and Catherine of Aragon)
frowned upon him,"<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> and the sky, growing darker around him,
gave token of the storm that was to overwhelm him. If the
<i>cause</i> failed, Wolsey incurred the vengeance of the king; if it
succeeded, he would be delivered up to the vengeance of the
Boleyns, without speaking of Catherine's, the emperor's and the
pope's. Happy Campeggio! thought the cardinal, he has nothing
to fear. If Henry's favour is withdrawn from him, Charles and
Clement will make him compensation. But Wolsey lost every
thing when he lost the king's good graces. Detested by his
fellow-citizens, despised and hated by all Europe, he saw to
whatever side he turned nothing but the just reward of his
avarice and falseness. He strove in vain, as on other occasions,
to lean on the ambassador of France; Du Bellay was solicited
on the other side. "I am exposed here to such a heavy and
continual fire that I am half dead," exclaimed the bishop of
Bayonne;<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> and the cardinal met with an unusual reserve in his
former confidant.</p>

<p>Yet the crisis approached. Like a skilful but affrighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
pilot, Wolsey cast his eyes around him to discover a port in
which he could take refuge. He could find none but his see
of York. He therefore began once more to complain of the
fatigues of power, of the weariness of the diplomatic career, and
to extol the sweetness of an episcopal life. On a sudden he
felt a great interest about the flock of whom he had never
thought before. Those around him shook their heads, well
knowing that such a retreat would be to Wolsey the bitterest
of disgraces. One single idea supported him; if he fell, it would
be because he had clung more to the pope than to the king: he
would be the martyr of his faith.&mdash;What a faith, what a
martyr!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE BOLEYN AT HEVER.</div>

<p>While these things were taking place Anne was living at
Hever Castle in retirement and sadness. Scruples from time
to time still alarmed her conscience. It is true, the king represented
to her unceasingly that his salvation and the safety
of his people demanded the dissolution of a union condemned
by the divine law, and that what he solicited several popes had
granted. Had not Alexander VI annulled, after ten years, the
marriage of Ladislaus and Beatrice of Naples? Had not Louis
XII, the father of his people, been divorced from Joan of
France? Nothing was more common, he said, than to see the
divorce of a prince authorized by a pope; the security of the
state must be provided for before every thing else. Carried
away by these arguments and dazzled by the splendour of a
throne, Anne Boleyn consented to usurp at Henry's side the
rank belonging to another. Yet, if she was imprudent and ambitious,
she was feeling and generous, and the misfortunes of a
queen whom she respected soon made her reject with terror the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
idea of taking her place. The fertile pastures of Kent and the
gothic halls of Hever Castle were by turns the witnesses of the
mental conflicts this young lady experienced. The fear she
entertained of seeing the queen again, and the idea that the two
cardinals, her enemies, were plotting her ruin, made her adopt
the resolution of not returning to court, and she shut herself up
in her solitary chamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE RECALLED TO COURT.</div>

<p>Anne had neither the deep piety of a Bilney, nor the somewhat
vague and mystic spirituality observable in Margaret of
Valois; it was not feeling which prevailed in her religion, it was
knowledge, and a horror of superstition and pharisaism. Her
mind required light and activity, and at that time she sought
in reading the consolations so necessary to her position. One
day she opened one of the books prohibited in England, which
a friend of the Reformation had given her: <i>The Obedience of
a Christian Man</i>. Its author was William Tyndale, that invisible
man whom Wolsey's agents were hunting for in Brabant
and Germany, and this was a recommendation to Anne. "If thou
believe the promises," she read, "then God's truth justifieth
thee; that is, forgiveth thy sins and sealeth thee with his Holy
Spirit. If thou have true faith, so seest thou the exceeding
and infinite love and mercy which God hath shown thee freely in
Christ: then must thou needs love again: and love cannot but
compel thee to work. If when tyrants oppose thee thou have
power to confess, then art thou sure that thou art safe.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> If
thou be fallen from the way of truth, come thereto again and
thou art safe. Yea, Christ shall save thee, and the angels of
heaven shall rejoice at thy coming."<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> These words did not
change Anne's heart, but she marked with her nail, as was her
custom,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> other passages which struck her more, and which she
desired to point out to the king if, as she hoped, she was ever
to meet him again. She believed that the truth was there, and
took a lively interest in those whom Wolsey, Henry, and the
pope were at that time persecuting.</p>

<p>Anne was soon dragged from these pious lessons, and launched
into the midst of a world full of dangers. Henry, convinced
that he had nothing to expect henceforward from Campeggio,
neglected those proprieties which he had hitherto observed, and
immediately after the adjournment ordered Anne Boleyn to return
to court; he restored her to the place she had formerly
occupied, and even surrounded her with increased splendour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Every one saw that Anne, in the king's mind, was queen of
England; and a powerful party was formed around her, which,
proposed to accomplish the definitive ruin of the cardinal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISS GAINSFORD AND GEORGE ZOUCH.</div>

<p>After her return to court, Anne read much less frequently
<i>The Obedience of a Christian Man</i> and the <i>Testament of Jesus
Christ</i>. Henry's homage, her friends' intrigues, and the whirl
of festivities, bade fair to stifle the thoughts which solitude had
aroused in her heart. One day having left Tyndale's book in
a window, Miss Gainsford, a fair young gentlewoman<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> attached
to her person, took it up and read it. A gentleman of handsome
mien, cheerful temper, and extreme mildness, named
George Zouch, also belonging to Anne's household, and betrothed
to Miss Gainsford, profiting by the liberty his position gave
him, indulged sometimes in "love tricks."<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> On one occasion
when George desired to have a little talk with her, he was annoyed
to find her absorbed by a book of whose contents he
knew nothing; and taking advantage of a moment when the
young lady had turned away her head, he laughingly snatched
it from her. Miss Gainsford ran after Zouch to recover her
book; but just at that moment she heard her mistress calling
her, and she left George, threatening him with her finger.</p>

<p>As she did not return immediately, George withdrew to his
room, and opened the volume; it was the <i>Obedience of a Christian
Man</i>. He glanced over a few lines, then a few pages, and
at last read the book through more than once. He seemed to
hear the voice of God. "I feel the Spirit of God," he said,
"speaking in my heart as he has spoken in the heart of him
who wrote the book."<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> The words which had only made a
temporary impression on the preoccupied mind of Anne Boleyn,
penetrated to the heart of her equerry and converted him.
Miss Gainsford, fearing that Anne would ask for her book, entreated
George to restore it to her; but he positively refused,
and even the young lady's tears failed to make him give up a
volume in which he had found the life of his soul. Becoming
more serious, he no longer jested as before; and when Miss
Gainsford peremptorily demanded the book, he was, says the
chronicler, "ready to weep himself."</p>

<p>Zouch, finding in this volume an edification which empty
forms and ceremonies could not give, used to carry it with him
to the king's chapel. Dr. Sampson, the dean, generally officiated;
and while the choir chanted the service, George would be
absorbed in his book, where he read: "If when thou seest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
celebration of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, thou believest
in this promise of Christ: <i>This is my body that is broken for you</i>,
and if thou have this promise fast in thine heart, thou art saved
and justified thereby; thou eatest his body and drinkest his
blood. If not, so helpeth it thee not, though thou hearest a
thousand masses in a day: no more than it should help thee in
a dead thirst to behold a bush at a tavern door, if thou knewest
not thereby that there was wine within to be sold."<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> The
young man dwelt upon these words: by faith he ate the body
and drank the blood of the Son of God. This was what was
passing in the palaces of Henry VIII; there were saints in the
household of Cæsar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNE BOLEYN BEFORE THE KING.</div>

<p>Wolsey, desirous of removing from the court everything that
might favour the Reformation, had recommended extreme
vigilance to Dr. Sampson so as to prevent the circulation of the
innovating books. Accordingly, one day when George was in
the chapel absorbed in his book, the dean, who, even while
officiating, had not lost sight of the young man, called him to
him after the service, and rudely taking the book from his
hands, demanded: "What is your name, and in whose service
are you?" Zouch having replied, the dean withdrew with a
very angry look, and carried his prey to the cardinal.</p>

<p>When Miss Gainsford heard of this mishap, her grief was
extreme; she trembled at the thought that the <i>Obedience of a
Christian Man</i> was in Wolsey's hands. Not long after this,
Anne having asked for her book, the young lady fell on her
knees, confessed all, and begged to be forgiven.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Anne uttered
not a word of reproach; her quick mind saw immediately the
advantage she might derive from this affair. "Well," said she,
"it shall be the dearest book to them that ever the dean or
cardinal took away."</p>

<p>"The noble lady," as the chronicler styles her, immediately
demanded an interview of the king, and on reaching his presence
she fell at his feet,<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> and begged his assistance. "What
is the matter, Anne," said the astonished monarch. She told
him what had happened, and Henry promised that the book
should not remain in Wolsey's hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING READS TYNDALE'S BOOK.</div>

<p>Anne had scarcely quitted the royal apartments when the
cardinal arrived with the famous volume, with the intention of
complaining to Henry of certain passages which he knew could
not fail to irritate him, and to take advantage of it even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
attack Anne, if the king should be offended.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> Henry's icy reception
closed his mouth; the king confined himself to taking the
book, and bowing out the cardinal. This was precisely what
Anne had hoped for. She begged the king to read the book,
which he promised to do.</p>

<p>And Henry accordingly shut himself up in his closet, and
read the <i>Obedience of a Christian Man</i>. There were few works
better calculated to enlighten him, and none, after the Bible,
that has had more influence upon the Reformation in England.
Tyndale treated of <i>obedience</i>, "the essential principle," as he
terms it, "of every political or religious community." He declaimed
against the unlawful power of the popes, who usurped
the lawful authority of Christ and of his Word. He professed
political-doctrines too favourable doubtless to absolute power,
but calculated to show that the reformers were not, as had
been asserted, instigators of rebellion. Henry read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The king is in the room of God in this world. He that resisteth
the king, resisteth God; he that judgeth the king, judgeth
God. He is the minister of God to defend thee from a thousand
inconveniences; though he be the greatest tyrant in the
world, yet is he unto thee a great benefit of God; for it is better
to pay the tenth than to lose all, and to suffer wrong of one
man than of every man."<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>These are indeed strange doctrines for <i>rebels</i> to hold, thought
the king; and he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let kings, if they had lever [rather] be Christians in deed
than so to be called, give themselves altogether to the wealth
[well-being] of their realms after the ensample of Jesus Christ;
remembering that the people are God's, and not theirs; yea, are
Christ's inheritance, bought with his blood. The most despised
person in his realm (if he is a Christian) is equal with him in
the kingdom of God and of Christ. Let the king put off all
pride, and become a brother to the poorest of his subjects."<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TYNDALE'S DOCTRINE ON KINGS.</div>

<p>It is probable that these words were less satisfactory to the
king. He kept on reading:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Emperors and kings are nothing now-a-days, but even hangmen
unto the pope and bishops, to kill whomsoever they condemn,
as Pilate was unto the scribes and pharisees and high
bishops to hang Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>This seemed to Henry rather strong language.</p>

<p>"The pope hath received no other authority of Christ than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to preach God's word. Now, this word should rule only, and
not bishops' decrees or the pope's pleasure. <i>In præsentia majoris
cessat potestas minoris</i>, in the presence of the greater, the less
hath no power.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> The pope, against all the doctrine of Christ,
which saith, <i>My kingdom is not of this world</i>, hath usurped the
right of the emperor. Kings must make account of their doings
only to God.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> No person may be exempt from this ordinance
of God; neither can the profession of monks and friars, or anything
that the popes or bishops can lay for themselves, except
them from the sword of the emperor or king, if they break the
laws. For it is written, (Rom. xiii.) Let every soul submit
himself unto the authority of the higher powers."<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>"What excellent reading!" exclaimed Henry, when he had
finished; "this is truly a book for all kings to read, and for me
particularly."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>Captivated by Tyndale's work, the king began to converse
with Anne about the church and the pope; and she who had
seen Margaret of Valois unassumingly endeavour to instruct
Francis I strove in like manner to enlighten Henry VIII. She
did not possess the influence over him she desired; this unhappy
prince was, to the very end of his life, opposed to the evangelical
reformation; protestants and catholics have been equally
mistaken when they have regarded him as being favourable to
it. "In a short time," says the annalist quoted by Strype at
the end of his narrative, "the king, by the help of this virtuous
lady, had his eyes opened to the truth. He learned to seek
after that truth, to advance God's religion and glory, to detest
the pope's doctrine, his lies, his pomp, and pride, and to deliver
his subjects from the Egyptian darkness and Babylonian bonds
that the pope had brought him and his subjects under. Despising
the rebellions of his subjects and the rage of so many
mighty potentates abroad, he set forward a religious reformation,
which, beginning with the triple-crowned head, came down
to all the members of the hierarchy." History has rarely delivered
a more erroneous judgment. Henry's eyes were never
opened to the truth, and it was not he who made the Reformation.
It was accomplished first of all by Scripture, and then
by the ministry of simple and faithful men baptized of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COURT AT WOODSTOCK.</div>

<p>Yet Tyndale's book and the conduct of the legates had given
rise in the king's mind to new thoughts which he sought
time to mature. He desired also to conceal his anger from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Wolsey and Campeggio, and dissipate his <i>spleen</i>, says the historian
Collyer; he therefore gave orders to remove the court to
the palace of Woodstock. The magnificent park attached to this
royal residence, in which was the celebrated bower constructed
(it is said) by Henry II to conceal the fair Rosamond, offered
all the charms of the promenade, the chase, and solitude.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>
Hence he could easily repair to Langly, Grafton, and other
country seats. It was not long before the entertainments,
horse-races, and other rural sports began. The world with its
pleasures and its grandeur, were at the bottom the idols of Anne
Boleyn's heart; but yet she felt a certain attraction for the new
doctrine, which was confounded in her mind with the great
cause of all knowledge, perhaps even with her own. More enlightened
than the generality of women, she was distinguished
by the superiority of her understanding not only over her own sex,
but even over many of the gentlemen of the court. While
Catherine, a member of the third order of St. Francis, indulged
in trifling practices, the more intelligent, if not more pious
Anne, cared but little for amulets which the friars had blessed,
for apparitions, or visions of angels. Woodstock furnished her
with an opportunity of curing Henry VIII of the superstitious
ideas natural to him. There was a place in the forest said to
be haunted by evil spirits; not a priest or a courtier dared approach
it. A tradition ran that if a king ventured to cross the
boundary, he would fall dead. Anne resolved to take Henry
there. Accordingly, one morning she led the way in the direction
of the place where these mysterious powers manifested their
presence (as it was said) by strange apparitions; they entered the
wood; they arrived at the so much dreaded spot; all hesitated;
but Anne's calmness reassured her companions; they advanced;
they found ... nothing but trees and turf, and, laughing at
their former terrors, they explored every corner of this mysterious
resort of the evil spirits. Anne returned to the palace, congratulating
herself on the triumph Henry had gained over his
imaginary fears.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> This prince, who could as yet bear with
superiority in others, was struck with Anne Boleyn's.</p>

<p>These verses of Clement Marot, written in honour of Margaret
of Valois, faithfully express what Henry then felt for
Anne, who had been with Marot in the household of that
princess. Henry's love may perhaps have deceived him, as to
Anne's excellencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMBARRASSMENT OF THE POPE.</div>

<p>While the court was thus taking its pleasure at Woodstock,
Wolsey remained in London, a prey to the acutest anguish.
"This avocation to Rome," wrote he to Gregory De Casale,
"will not only completely alienate the king and his realm from
the apostolic see, but will ruin me utterly."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> This message had
hardly reached the pope, before the imperial ambassadors handed
to him the queen's protest, and added in a very significant
tone: "If your holiness does not call this cause before you, the
emperor, who is determined to bring it to an end, will have recourse
to <i>other arguments</i>." The same perplexity always
agitated Clement: Which of the two must be sacrificed, Henry
or Charles? Anthony de Leyva, who commanded the imperial
forces, having routed the French army, the pope no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
doubted that Charles was the elect of Heaven. It was not
Europe alone which acknowledged this prince's authority; a new
world had just laid its power and its gold at his feet. The formidable
priest-king of the Aztecs had been unable to withstand
Cortez; could the priest-king of Rome withstand Charles V?
Cortez had returned from Mexico, bringing with him Mexican
chiefs in all their barbarous splendour, with thousands of <i>pesos</i>,
with gold and silver and emeralds of extraordinary size, with
magnificent tissues and birds of brilliant plumage. He had accompanied
Charles, who was then going to Italy, to the place
of embarkation, and had sent to Clement VII costly gifts of the
precious metals, valuable jewels, and a troop of Mexican dancers,
buffoons, and jugglers, who charmed the pope and the cardinal
above all things.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE BETWEEN CLEMENT AND CHARLES.</div>

<p>Clement, even while refusing Henry's prayer, had not as yet
granted the emperor's. He thought he could now resist no
longer the star of a monarch victorious over two worlds, and
hastened to enter into negotiations with him. Sudden terrors
still assailed him from time to time: My refusal (he said to
himself) may perhaps cause me to lose England. But Charles,
holding him in his powerful grasp, compelled him to submit.
Henry's antecedents were rather encouraging to the pontiff.
How could he imagine that a prince, who alone of all the monarchs
of Europe had once contended against the great reformer,
would now separate from the popedom? On the 6th of July
Clement declared to the English envoys that he <i>avoked to Rome</i>
the cause between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. In
other words, this was refusing the divorce. "There are twenty
three points in this case," said the courtiers, "and the debate
on the first has lasted a year; before the end of the trial, the
king will be not only past marrying but past living."<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>When he learned that the fatal blow had been struck, Bennett
in a tone of sadness exclaimed: "Alas! most holy father,
by this act the Church in England will be utterly destroyed; the
king declared it to me with tears in his eyes."<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>&mdash;"Why is it
my fortune to live in such evil days?" replied the pope, who, in
his turn, began to weep;<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> "but I am encircled by the emperor's
forces, and if I were to please the king, I should draw a fearful
ruin upon myself and upon the church.... God will be my
judge."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S ANGER.</div>

<p>On the 15th of July Da Casale sent the fatal news to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
English minister. The king was cited before the pope, and in
case of refusal condemned in a fine of 10,000 ducats. On the
18th of July peace was proclaimed at Rome between the pontiff
and the emperor, and on the next day (these dates are important)
Clement, wishing still to make one more attempt to ward off
the blow with which the papacy was threatened, wrote to Cardinal
Wolsey: "My dear son, how can I describe to you my affliction?
Show in this matter the prudence which so distinguishes
you, and preserve the king in those kindly feelings which
he has ever manifested towards me."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> A useless attempt! Far
from saving the papacy, Wolsey was to be wrecked along
with it.</p>

<p>Wolsey was thunderstruck. At the very time he was assuring
Henry of the attachment of Clement and Francis, both were
deserting him. The "politic handling" failed, which the cardinal
had thought so skilful, and which had been so torturous.
Henry now had none but enemies on the continent of Europe,
and the Reformation was daily spreading over his kingdom.
Wolsey's anguish cannot be described. His power, his pomp,
his palaces were all threatened; who could tell whether he would
even preserve his liberty and his life.&mdash;A just reward for so
much duplicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY CONCEALS HIS AFFRONT.</div>

<p>But the king's wrath was to be greater than even the minister's
alarm. His terrified servants wondered how they should announce
the pontiff's decision. Gardiner, who, after his return
from Rome, had been named secretary of state, went down to
Langley on the 3rd of August to communicate it to him. What
news for the proud Tudor! The decision on the divorce was
forbidden in England; the cause avoked to Rome, there to be
buried and unjustly lost; Francis I treating with the emperor;
Charles and Clement on the point of exchanging at Bologna the
most striking signs of their unchangeable alliance; the services
rendered by the king to the popedom repaid with the blackest
ingratitude; his hope of giving an heir to the crown disgracefully
frustrated; and last, but not least, Henry VIII, the proudest monarch
of Christendom, summoned to Rome to appear before an ecclesiastical
tribunal ... it was too much for Henry. His wrath, a
moment restrained, burst forth like a clap of thunder,<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> and all
trembled around him. "Do they presume," he exclaimed, "to
try my cause elsewhere than in my own dominions? I, the king
of England, summoned before an Italian tribunal!... Yes, ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
I will go to Rome, but it shall be with such a mighty army
that the pope, and his priests, and all Italy shall be struck with
terror.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>&mdash;I forbid the letters of citation to be executed," he
continued; "I forbid the commission to consider its functions at
an end." Henry would have desired to tear off Campeggio's
purple robes, and throw this prince of the Roman church into
prison, in order to frighten Clement; but the very magnitude of
the insult compelled him to restrain himself. He feared above
all things to appear humbled in the eyes of England, and he
hoped, by showing moderation, to hide the affront he had received.
"Let everything be done," he told Gardiner, "to conceal
from my subjects these letters of citation, which are so
hurtful to my glory. Write to Wolsey that I have the greatest
confidence in his dexterity, and that he ought, by good handling,
to win over Campeggio<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> and the queen's counsellors, and,
above all, prevail upon them at any price not to serve these
citatory letters on me." But Henry had hardly given his instructions
when the insult of which he had been the object recurred
to his imagination; the thought of Clement haunted him night
and day, and he swore to exact a striking vengeance from the
pontiff. Rome desires to have no more to do with England....
England in her turn will cast off Rome. Henry will sacrifice
Wolsey, Clement, and the church; nothing shall stop his fury.
The crafty pontiff has concealed his game, the king shall beat
him openly; and from age to age the popedom shall shed tears
over the imprudent folly of a medici.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S DISFAVOUR.</div>

<p>Thus after insupportable delays which had fatigued the nation,
a thunderbolt fell upon England. Court, clergy, and
people, from whom it was impossible to conceal these great
events, were deeply stirred, and the whole kingdom was in commotion.
Wolsey, still hoping to ward off the ruin impending
over both himself and the papacy, immediately put in play all
that dexterity which Henry had spoken of; he so far prevailed
that the letters citatorial were not served on the king, but only
the brief addressed to Wolsey by Clement VII.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> The cardinal,
all radiant with this trivial success, and desirous of profiting by
it to raise his credit, resolved to accompany Campeggio, who
was going down to Grafton to take leave of the king. When
the coming of the two legates was heard of at court, the agitation
was very great. The dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
this proceeding as the last effort of their enemy, and entreated
Henry not to receive him. "The king will receive him," said
some. "The king will not receive him," answered others. At
length one Sunday morning it was announced that the prelates
were at the gates of the mansion. Wolsey looked round with
an anxious eye for the great officers who were accustomed to
introduce him. They appeared, and desired Campeggio to
follow them. When the legate had been taken to his apartments,
Wolsey waited his turn; but great was his consternation
on being informed that there was no chamber appointed for him
in the palace. Sir Henry Norris, groom of the stole, offered
Wolsey the use of his own room, and the cardinal followed him,
almost sinking beneath the humiliation he had undergone.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> He
made ready to appear before the king, and summoning up his
courage, proceeded to the presence-chamber.</p>

<p>The lords of the council were standing in a row according to
their rank; Wolsey, taking off his hat, passed along saluting each
of them with affected civility. A great number of courtiers
arrived, impatient to see how Henry would receive his old favourite;
and most of them were already exulting in the striking
disgrace of which they hoped to be witnesses. At last the king
was announced.</p>

<p>Henry stood under the cloth of state; and Wolsey advanced
and knelt before him. Deep silence prevailed throughout the
chamber.... To the surprise of all, Henry stooped down
and raised him up with both hands.... Then, with a pleasing
smile, he took Wolsey to the window, desired him to put on
his hat, and talked familiarly with him. "Then," says Cavendish,
the cardinal's gentleman usher, "it would have made you
smile to behold the countenances of those who had laid wagers
that the king would not speak with him."</p>

<p>But this was the last ray of evening which then lighted up
the darkening fortunes of Wolsey: the star of his favour was
about to set for ever.... The silence continued, for every one
desired to catch a few words of the conversation. The king
seemed to be accusing Wolsey, and Wolsey to be justifying himself.
On a sudden Henry pulled a letter out of his bosom, and
showing it to the cardinal, said in a loud voice: "How can that
be? is not this your hand?" It was no doubt the letter which
Bryan had intercepted. Wolsey replied in an under-tone, and
seemed to have appeased his master. The dinner hour having
arrived, the king left the room telling Wolsey that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
not fail to see him again; the courtiers were eager to make
their profoundest reverences to the cardinal, but he haughtily
traversed the chamber, and the dukes hastened to carry to
Anne Boleyn the news of this astonishing reception.</p>

<p>Wolsey, Campeggio, and the lords of the council sat down to
dinner. The cardinal, well aware that the terrible letter would be
his utter ruin, and that Henry's good graces had no other object
than to prepare his fall, began to hint at his retirement. "Truly,"
said he with a devout air, "the king would do well to send
his bishops and chaplains home to their cures and benefices."
The company looked at one another with astonishment. "Yea,
marry," said the duke of Norfolk somewhat rudely, "and so it
were meet for you to do also."&mdash;"I should be very well contented
therewith," answered Wolsey, "if it were the king's pleasure
to license me with leave to go to my cure at Winchester."&mdash;"Nay,
to your benefice at York, where your greatest honour
and charge is," replied Norfolk, who was not willing that Wolsey
should be living so near Henry.&mdash;"Even as it shall please
the king," added Wolsey, and changed the subject of conversation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY AND ANNE BOLEYN.</div>

<p>Henry had caused himself to be announced to Anne Boleyn,
who (says Cavendish) "kept state at Grafton more like a queen
than a simple maid." Possessing extreme sensibility, and an
ardent imagination, Anne, who felt the slightest insult with all
the sensibility of her woman's heart, was very dissatisfied with
the king after the report of the dukes. Accordingly, heedless
of the presence of the attendants, she said to him: "Sir, is it
not a marvellous thing to see into what great danger the cardinal
hath brought you with all your subjects?"&mdash;"How so,
sweetheart?" asked Henry. Anne continued: "Are you ignorant
of the hatred his exactions have drawn upon you? There
is not a man in your whole realm of England worth one hundred
pounds, but he hath made you his debtor." Anne here
alluded to the loan the king had raised among his subjects.
"Well, well," said Henry, who was not pleased with these remarks,
"I know that matter better than you."&mdash;"If my lord
of Norfolk, my lord of Suffolk, my uncle, or my father had done
much less than the cardinal hath done," continued Anne, "they
would have lost their heads ere this." "Then I perceive,"
said Henry, "you are none of his friends."&mdash;"No, sir, I have
no cause, nor any that love you," she replied. The dinner was
ended; the king, without appearing at all touched, proceeded to
the presence-chamber where Wolsey expected him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S LAST INTERVIEW.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>After a long conversation, carried on in a low tone, the king
took Wolsey by the hand and led him into his private chamber.
The courtiers awaited impatiently the termination of an interview
which might decide the fate of England; they walked up
and down the gallery, often passing before the door of the closet,
in the hope of catching from Wolsey's looks, when he opened it,
the result of this secret conference; but one quarter of an hour
followed another, these became hours, and still the cardinal did
not appear. Henry having resolved that this conversation should
be the last, was no doubt collecting from his minister all the
information necessary to him. But the courtiers imagined he
was returning into his master's favour; Norfolk, Suffolk, Wiltshire,
and the other enemies of the prime minister, began to
grow alarmed, and hastened off to Anne Boleyn, who was their
last hope.</p>

<p>It was night when the king and Wolsey quitted the royal
closet; the former appeared gracious, the latter satisfied; it was
always Henry's custom to smile on those he intended to sacrifice.
"I shall see you in the morning," he said to the cardinal with a
friendly air. Wolsey made a low bow, and, turning round to
the courtiers, saw the king's smile reflected on their faces. Wiltshire,
Tuke, and even Suffolk, were full of civility. "Well,"
thought he, "the motion of such weathercocks as these shows
me from what quarter the wind of favour is blowing."<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>But a moment after the wind began to change. Men with
torches waited for the cardinal at the gates of the palace to conduct
him to the place where he would have to pass the night.
Thus he was not to sleep beneath the same roof with Henry.
He was to lie at Euston, one of Empson's houses, about three
miles off. Wolsey, repressing his vexation, mounted his horse,
the footmen preceded him with their links, and after an hour's
riding along very bad roads, he reached the lodging assigned
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING'S FAREWELL TO WOLSEY.</div>

<p>He had sat down to supper, to which some of his most intimate
friends had been invited, when suddenly Gardiner was
announced. Gardiner owed every thing to the cardinal, and
yet he had not appeared before him since his return from Rome.
He comes no doubt to play the hypocrite and the spy, thought
Wolsey. But as soon as the secretary entered, Wolsey rose,
made him a graceful compliment, and prayed him to take a
seat. "Master Secretary," he asked, "where have you been
since your return from Rome?"&mdash;"I have been following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
court from place to place."&mdash;"You have been hunting then?
Have you any dogs?" asked the prime minister, who knew very
well what Gardiner had been doing in the king's closet. "A
few," replied Gardiner. Wolsey thought that even the secretary
was a bloodhound on his track. And yet after supper he took
Gardiner aside, and conversed with him until midnight. He
thought it prudent to neglect nothing that might clear up his
position; and Wolsey sounded Gardiner, just as he himself had
been sounded by Henry not long before.</p>

<p>The same night at Grafton the king gave Campeggio a farewell
audience, and treated him very kindly, "by giving him
presents and other matters," says Du Bellay. Henry then returned
to Anne Boleyn. The dukes had pointed out to her the
importance of the present moment; she therefore asked and
obtained of Henry, without any great difficulty, his promise
never to speak to his minister again.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> The insults of the papacy
had exasperated the king of England, and as he could not
punish Clement, he took his revenge on the cardinal.</p>

<p>The next morning, Wolsey, impatient to have the interview
which Henry had promised, rode back early to Grafton. But
as he came near, he met a numerous train of servants and
sumpter-horses; and presently afterwards Henry, with Anne
Boleyn and many lords and ladies of the court, came riding up.
"What does all this mean?" thought the cardinal in dismay.
"My lord," said the king, as he drew near, "I cannot stay with
you now. You will return to London with cardinal Campeggio."
Then striking the spurs into his horse, Henry galloped off with
a friendly salutation. After him came Anne Boleyn, who rode
past Wolsey with head erect, and casting on him a proud look.
The court proceeded to Hartwell Park, where Anne had determined
to keep the king all day. Wolsey was confounded.
There was no room for doubt; his disgrace was certain. His
head swam, he remained immovable for an instant, and then
recovered himself; but the blow he had received had not been
unobserved by the courtiers, and the cardinal's fall became the
general topic of conversation.</p>

<p>After dinner, the legates departed, and on the second day
reached Moor Park, a mansion built by Archbishop Neville, one
of Wolsey's predecessors, who for high treason had been first
imprisoned at Calais, and afterwards at Ham. These recollections
were by no means agreeable to Wolsey. The next morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>ing
the two cardinals separated, Campeggio proceeded to Dover
and Wolsey to London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMPEGGIO SEARCHED AT DOVER.</div>

<p>Campeggio was impatient to get out of England, and great
was his annoyance, on reaching Dover, to find that the wind
was contrary. But a still greater vexation was in reserve. He
had hardly lain down to rest himself, before his door was opened,
and a band of sergeants entered the room. The cardinal, who
knew what scenes of this kind meant in Italy, thought he was a
dead man,<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> and fell trembling at his chaplain's feet begging for
absolution. Meantime the officers opened his luggage, broke
into his chests, scattered his property about the floor, and even
shook out his clothes.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<p>Henry's tranquility had not been of long duration. "Campeggio
is the bearer of letters from Wolsey to Rome," whispered
some of the courtiers; "who knows but they contain treasonable
matter?" "There is, too, among his papers the famous <i>decretal</i>
pronouncing the divorce," said one; "if we had but that document
it would finish the business." Another affirmed that
Campeggio "had large treasure with him of my lord's (Wolsey's)
to be conveyed in great tuns to Rome,"<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> whither it was
surmised the cardinal of York would escape to enjoy the fruits
of his treason. "It is certain," added a third, "that Campeggio,
assisted by Wolsey, has been able to procure your majesty's
correspondence with Anne Boleyn, and is carrying it away
with him." Henry, therefore, sent a messenger after the
nuncio, with orders that his baggage should be thoroughly
searched.</p>

<p>Nothing was found, neither letters, nor bull, nor treasures.
The bull had been destroyed; the treasures Wolsey had never
thought of intrusting to his colleague; and the letters of Anne
and Henry, Campeggio had sent on before by his son Rodolph,
and the pope was stretching out his hands to receive them,
proud, like his successors, of the robbery committed by two of
his legates.</p>

<p>Campeggio being reassured, and seeing that he was neither
to be killed nor robbed, made a great noise at this act of violence,
and at the insulting remarks which had given rise to it.
"I will not leave England," he caused Henry to be informed,
"until I have received satisfaction." "My lord forgets that he
is legate no longer," replied the king, "since the pope has withdrawn
his power; he forgets, besides, that, as bishop of Salis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>bury,
he is my subject; as for the remarks against him and the
cardinal of York, it is a liberty the people of England are accustomed
to take, and which I cannot put down." Campeggio,
anxious to reach France, was satisfied with these reasons, and
soon forgot all his sorrows at the sumptuous table of cardinal
Duprat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S DESOLATION.</div>

<p>Wolsey was not so fortunate. He had seen Campeggio go
away, and remained like a wrecked seaman thrown on a desert
isle, who has seen depart the only friends capable of giving him
any help. His necromancy had forewarned him that this would
be a fatal year.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> The angel of the maid of Kent had said: "Go
to the cardinal and announce his fall, because he has not done
what you had commanded him to do."<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Other voices besides
hers made themselves heard: the hatred of the nation, the contempt
of Europe, and, above all, Henry's anger, told him that
his hour was come. It was true the pope said, that he would
do all in his power to save him;<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> but Clement's good offices
would only accelerate his ruin. Du Bellay, whom the people
believed to be the cardinal's accomplice, bore witness to the
change that had taken place in men's minds. While passing on
foot through the streets of the capital, followed by two valets,
"his ears were so filled with coarse jests as he went along," he
said, "that he knew not which way to turn."<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> "The cardinal
is utterly undone," he wrote; "and I see not how he can
escape." The idea occurred to Wolsey, from time to time, to
pronounce the divorce himself; but it was too late. He was
even told that his life was in danger. Fortune, blind and bald,
her foot on the wheel, fled rapidly from him, nor was it in
his power to stop her. And this was not all: after him (he
thought) there was no one who could uphold the church of
the pontiffs in England. The ship of Rome was sailing on a
stormy sea among rocks and shoals; Wolsey at the helm looked
in vain for a port of refuge; the vessel leaked on every side; it
was rapidly sinking, and the cardinal uttered a cry of distress.
Alas! he had desired to save Rome, but Rome would not have
it so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOMAS CRANMER.</div>

<p>As Wolsey's star was disappearing in the West in the midst
of stormy clouds, another was rising in the East, to point out
the way to save Britain. Men, like stars, appear on the horizon
at the command of God.</p>

<p>On his return from Woodstock to Greenwich, Henry stopped
full of anxiety at Waltham in Essex. His attendants were
lodged in the houses of the neighbourhood. Fox, the almoner,
and Secretary Gardiner, were quartered on a gentleman named
Cressy, at Waltham Abbey. When supper was announced,
Gardiner and Fox were surprised to see an old friend enter the
room. It was Thomas Cranmer, a Cambridge doctor. "What!
is it you?" they said, "and how came you here?" "Our host's
wife is my relation," replied Cranmer, "and as the epidemic is
raging at Cambridge, I brought home my friend's sons, who are
under my care." As this new personage is destined to play an
important part in the history of the Reformation, it may be
worth our while to interrupt our narrative, and give a particular
account of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRANMER'S FIRST MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>Cranmer was descended from an ancient family, which came
into England, as is generally believed, with the Conqueror. He
was born at Aslacton in Nottinghamshire on the 2nd of July
1489, six years after Luther. His early education had been
very much neglected; his tutor, an ignorant and severe priest,
had taught him little else than patiently to endure severe chastisement&mdash;a
knowledge destined to be very useful to him in
after-life. His father was an honest country gentleman, who
cared for little besides hunting, racing, and military sports. At
this school, the son learnt to ride, to handle the bow and the
sword, to fish, and to hawk; and he never entirely neglected
these exercises, which he thought essential to his health. Thomas
Cranmer was fond of walking, of the charms of nature, and
of solitary meditations; and a hill, near his father's mansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
used often to be shown where he was wont to sit, gazing on the
fertile country at his feet, fixing his eyes on the distant spires,
listening with melancholy pleasure to the chime of the bells,
and indulging in sweet contemplations. About 1504, he was
sent to Cambridge, where "barbarism still prevailed," says an
historian.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> His plain, noble, and modest air conciliated the
affections of many, and, in 1510, he was elected fellow of Jesus
College. Possessing a tender heart, he became attached, at the
age of twenty-three, to a young person of good birth (says
Foxe,) or of inferior rank, as other writers assert. Cranmer
was unwilling to imitate the disorderly lives of his fellow-students,
and although marriage would necessarily close the career
of honours, he married the young lady, resigned his fellowship
(in conformity with the regulations), and took a modest lodging
at the Dolphin. He then began to study earnestly the most
remarkable writings of the times, polishing, it has been said, his
old asperity on the productions of Erasmus, of Lefevre of Etaples,
and other great authors; every day his crude understanding
received new brilliancy.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> He then began to teach in Buckingham

his wants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRANMER ON THE DIVORCE.</div>

<p>His lessons excited the admiration of enlightened men, and
the anger of obscure ones, who disdainfully called him (because
of the inn at which he lodged) <i>the hostler</i>. "This name became
him well," said Fuller, "for in his lessons he roughly rubbed the
backs of the friars, and famously curried the hides of the lazy
priests." His wife dying a year after his marriage, Cranmer was
re-elected fellow of his old college, and the first writing of Luther's
having appeared, he said: "I must know on which side
the truth lies. There is only one infallible source, the Scriptures;
in them I will seek for God's truth."<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> And for three
years he constantly studied the holy books,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> without commentary,
without human theology, and hence he gained the name of
the <i>Scripturist</i>. At last his eyes were opened; he saw the mysterious
bond which unites all biblical revelations, and understood
the completeness of God's design. Then without forsaking the
Scriptures, he studied all kinds of authors.<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> He was a slow
reader, but a close observer;<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> he never opened a book without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
having a pen in his hand.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> He did not take up with any particular
party or age; but possessing a free and philosophic
mind, he weighed all opinions in the balance of his judgment,<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
taking the Bible for his standard.</p>

<p>Honours soon came upon him; he was made successively doctor
of divinity, professor, university preacher, and examiner.
He used to say to the candidates for the ministry: "Christ
sendeth his hearers to the Scriptures, and not to the church."<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>&mdash;"But,"
replied the monks, "they are so difficult."&mdash;"Explain
the obscure passages by those which are clear," rejoined
the professor, "Scripture by Scripture. Seek, pray, <i>and he who
has the key of David</i> will open them to you." The monks, affrighted
at this task, withdrew bursting with anger; and erelong
Cranmer's name was a name of dread in every convent. Some,
however, submitted to the labour, and one of them, Doctor
Barret, blessed God that the examiner had turned him back;
"for," said he, "I found the knowledge of God in the holy book
he compelled me to study." Cranmer toiled at the same work
as Latimer, Stafford, and Bilney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRANMER'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>Fox and Gardiner having renewed acquaintance with their
old friend at Waltham Abbey, they sat down to table, and
both the almoner and the secretary asked the doctor what
he thought of the divorce. It was the usual topic of conversation,
and not long before, Cranmer had been named member of
a commission appointed to give their opinion on this affair.
"You are not in the right path," said Cranmer to his friends;
"you should not cling to the decisions of the church. There is
a surer and a shorter way which alone can give peace to the
king's conscience."&mdash;"What is that?" they both asked. "The
true question is this," replied Cranmer: "<i>What says the Word
of God?</i> If God has declared a marriage of this nature <i>bad</i>, the
pope cannot make it <i>good</i>. Discontinue these interminable
Roman negotiations. When God has spoken man must obey."&mdash;"But
how shall we know what God has said?"&mdash;"Consult the
universities; they will discern it more surely than Rome."</p>

<p>This was a new view. The idea of consulting the universities
had been acted upon before; but then their own opinions only had
been demanded; now, the question was simply to know <i>what
God says in his word</i>. "The word of God is above the church,"
was the principle laid down by Cranmer, and in that principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
consisted the whole of the Reformation. The conversation at
the supper-table of Waltham was destined to be one of those
secret springs which an invisible Hand sets in motion for the
accomplishment of his great designs. The Cambridge doctor,
suddenly transported from his study to the foot of the throne,
was on the point of becoming one of the principal instruments
of Divine wisdom.</p>

<p>The day after this conversation, Fox and Gardiner arrived at
Greenwich, and the king summoned them into his presence the
same evening. "Well, gentlemen," he said to them, "our
holidays are over; what shall we do now? If we still have recourse
to Rome, God knows when we shall see the end of this
matter."<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>&mdash;"It will not be necessary to take so long a journey,"
said Fox; "we know a shorter and surer way."&mdash;"What is it?"
asked the king eagerly.&mdash;"Doctor Cranmer, whom we met yesterday
at Waltham, thinks that the Bible should be the sole judge
in your cause." Gardiner, vexed at his colleague's frankness,
desired to claim all the honour of this luminous idea for himself;
but Henry did not listen to him. "Where is Doctor Cranmer?"
said he, much affected.<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> "Send, and fetch him immediately.
Mother of God! (this was his customary oath) this man has
the right sow by the ear.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> If this had only been suggested to
me two years ago, what expense and trouble I should have been
spared."</p>

<p>Cranmer had gone into Nottinghamshire; a messenger followed
and brought him back. "Why have you entangled me in this affair?"
he said to Fox and Gardiner. "Pray make my excuses to the
king." Gardiner, who wished for nothing better, promised to do all
he could; but it was of no use. "I will have no excuses," said
Henry. The wily courtier was obliged to make up his mind to
introduce the ingenuous and upright man, to whom that station,
which he himself had so coveted, was one day to belong.
Cranmer and Gardiner went down to Greenwich, both alike dissatisfied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRANMER'S INTERVIEW WITH HENRY.</div>

<p>Cranmer was then forty years of age, with pleasing features,
and mild and winning eyes, in which the candour of his soul
seemed to be reflected. Sensible to the pains as well as to the
pleasures of the heart, he was destined to be more exposed than
other men to anxieties and falls; a peaceful life in some remote
parsonage would have been more to his taste than the court of
Henry VIII. Blessed with a generous mind, unhappily he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
not possess the firmness necessary in a public man; a little stone
sufficed to make him stumble. His excellent understanding
showed him the better way; but his great timidity made him
fear the more dangerous. He was rather too fond of relying
upon the power of men, and made them unhappy concessions
with too great facility. If the king had questioned him, he
would never have dared advise so bold a course as that he had
pointed out; the advice had slipped from him at table during
the intimacy of familiar conversation. Yet he was sincere, and
after doing everything to escape from the consequences of his
frankness, he was ready to maintain the opinion he had given.</p>

<p>Henry, perceiving Cranmer's timidity, graciously approached
him. "What is your name," said the king endeavouring to put
him at his ease? "Did you not meet my secretary and my almoner
at Waltham?" And then he added: "Did you not speak to them
of my great affair?"&mdash;repeating the words ascribed to Cranmer.
The latter could not retreat: "Sir, it is true, I did say so."&mdash;"I
see," replied the king with animation, "that you have found the
breach through which we must storm the fortress. Now, Sir
doctor, I beg you, and as you are my subject I command you,
to lay aside every other occupation, and to bring my cause to a
conclusion in conformity with the ideas you have put forth.
All that I desire to know is, whether my marriage is contrary
to the laws of God or not. Employ all your skill in investigating
the subject, and thus bring comfort to my conscience as well
as to the queen's."<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>Cranmer was confounded; he recoiled from the idea of deciding
an affair on which depended, it might be, the destinies of
the nation, and sighed after the lonely fields of Aslacton. But
grasped by the vigorous hand of Henry, he was compelled to
advance. "Sir," said he, "pray intrust this matter to doctors
more learned than I am."&mdash;"I am very willing," answered the
king, "but I desire that you will also give me your opinion in
writing." And then summoning the earl of Wiltshire to his
presence, he said to him: "My lord, you will receive Doctor
Cranmer into your house at Durham Place, and let him have
all necessary quiet to compose a report for which I have asked
him." After this precise command, which admitted of no refusal,
Henry withdrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRANMER MEETS ANNE BOLEYN.</div>

<p>In this manner was Cranmer introduced by the king to Anne
Boleyn's father, and not, as some Romanist authors have asserted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
by Sir Thomas Boleyn to the king.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> Wiltshire conducted
Cranmer to Durham House (now the Adelphi in the Strand,)
and the pious doctor on whom Henry had imposed these quarters,
soon contracted a close friendship with Anne and her
father, and took advantage of it to teach them the value of the
Divine word, as <i>the pearl of great price</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> Henry, while profiting
by the address of a Wolsey and a Gardiner, paid little regard to
the men; but he respected Cranmer, even when opposed to him
in opinion, and until his death placed the learned doctor above
all his courtiers and all his clerks. The pious man often succeeds
better, even with the great ones of this world, than the
ambitious and the intriguing.</p>

<p>While Cranmer was rising notwithstanding his humility,
Wolsey was falling in despite of his stratagems. The cardinal
still governed the kingdom, gave instructions to ambassadors,
negotiated with princes, and filled his sumptuous palaces with
his haughtiness. The king could not make up his mind to turn
him off; the force of habit, the need he had of him, the recollection
of the services Henry had received from him, pleaded in
his favour. Wolsey without the seals appeared almost as inconceivable
as the king without his crown. Yet the fall of one of
the most powerful favourites recorded in history was inevitably
approaching, and we must now describe it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARDINAL'S LAST SITTING.</div>

<p>On the 9th of October, after the Michaelmas vacation, Wolsey,
desirous of showing a bold face, went and opened the high court
of chancery with his accustomed pomp; but he noticed, with uneasiness,
that none of the king's servants walked before him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
as they had been accustomed to do. He presided on the bench
with an inexpressible depression of spirits, and the various
members of the court sat before him with an absent air; there
was something gloomy and solemn in this sitting, as if all were
taking part in a funeral: it was destined indeed to be the last
act of the cardinal's power. Some days before (Foxe says on
the 1st of October) the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, with other
lords of the privy-council, had gone down to Windsor, and denounced
to the king Wolsey's unconstitutional relations with
the pope, his usurpations, "his robberies, and the discords sown
by his means between Christian princes."<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Such motives would
not have sufficed; but Henry had stronger. Wolsey had not
kept any of his promises in the matter of the divorce; it would
even appear that he had advised the pope to excommunicate
the king, and thus raise his people against him.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> This enormity
was not at that time known by the prince; it is even probable
that it did not take place until later. But Henry knew enough,
and he gave his attorney-general, Sir Christopher Hales, orders
to prosecute Wolsey.</p>

<p>Whilst the heart-broken cardinal was displaying his authority
for the last time in the court of chancery, the attorney-general
was accusing him in the King's Bench for having obtained papal
bulls conferring on him a jurisdiction which encroached on the
royal power; and calling for the application of the penalties of
<i>præmunire</i>. The two dukes received orders to demand the seals
from Wolsey; and the latter, informed of what had taken place,
did not quit his palace on the 10th, expecting every moment
the arrival of the messengers of the king's anger; but no one
appeared.</p>

<p>The next day the two dukes arrived: "It is the king's good
pleasure," said they to the cardinal, who remained seated in his
arm-chair, "that you give up the broad seal to us and retire to
Esher" (a country-seat near Hampton Court.) Wolsey, whose
presence of mind never failed him, demanded to see the commission
under which they were acting. "We have our orders
from his majesty's mouth," said they.&mdash;"That may be sufficient
for you," replied the cardinal, "but not for me. The great seal
of England was delivered to me by the hands of my sovereign;
I may not deliver it at the simple word of any lord, unless you
can show me your commission." Suffolk broke out into a passion,
but Wolsey remained calm, and the two dukes returned
to Windsor. This was the cardinal's last triumph.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HE GIVES UP THE GREAT SEAL.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>The rumour of his disgrace created an immense sensation at
court, in the city, and among the foreign ambassadors. Du
Bellay hastened to York Place (Whitehall) to contemplate this
great ruin and console his unhappy friend. He found Wolsey,
with dejected countenance and lustreless eyes, "shrunk to half
his wonted size," wrote the ambassador to Montmorency, "the
greatest example of fortune which was ever beheld." Wolsey
desired "to set forth his case" to him; but his thoughts were
confused, his language broken, "for heart and tongue both failed
him entirely;" he burst into tears. The ambassador regarded
him with compassion: "Alas!" thought he, "his enemies cannot
but feel pity for him." At last the unhappy cardinal recovered
his speech, but only to give way to despair. "I desire no more
authority," he exclaimed, "nor the pope's legation, nor the
broad seal of England.... I am ready to give up
every thing, even to my shirt.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>... I can live in a
hermitage, provided the king does not hold me in disgrace."
The ambassador "did all he could to comfort him," when
Wolsey, catching at the plank thrown out to him, exclaimed:
"Would that the king of France and madame might pray the
king to moderate his anger against me. But above all," he
added in alarm, "take care the king never knows that I have
solicited this of you." Du Bellay wrote indeed to France, that
the king and madame alone could "withdraw their affectionate
servant from the gates of hell," and Wolsey being informed
of these despatches, his hopes recovered a little. But
this bright gleam did not last long.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S LAST HOPES.</div>

<p>On Sunday the 17th of October, Norfolk and Suffolk re-appeared
at Whitehall, accompanied by Fitzwilliam, Taylor, and
Gardiner, Wolsey's former dependant. It was six in the evening;
they found the cardinal in an upper chamber, near the
great gallery, and presented the king's orders to him. Having
read them he said: "I am happy to obey his majesty's commands;"
then having ordered the great seal to be brought him,
he took it out of the white leather case in which he kept it,
and handed it to the dukes, who placed it in a box, covered with
crimson velvet, and ornamented with the arms of England,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>
ordered Gardiner to seal it up with red wax, and gave it to
Taylor to convey to the king.</p>

<p>Wolsey was thunderstruck; he was to drink the bitter cup
even to the dregs: he was ordered to leave his palace forthwith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
taking with him neither clothes, linen, nor plate; the dukes had
feared that he would convey away his treasures. Wolsey comprehended
the greatness of his misery; he found strength however
to say: "Since it is the kings' good pleasure to take my
house and all it contains, I am content to retire to Esher." The
dukes left him.</p>

<p>Wolsey remained alone. This astonishing man, who had risen
from a butcher's shop to the summit of earthly greatness&mdash;who,
for a word that displeased him, sent his master's most
faithful servants (Pace for instance) to the Tower&mdash;and who
had governed England as if he had been its monarch, and even
more, for he had governed without a parliament: was driven
out, and thrown, as it were, upon a dunghill. A sudden hope
flashed like lightning through his mind; perhaps the magnificence
of the spoils would appease Henry. Was not Esau pacified by
Jacob's present? Wolsey summoned his officers: "Set tables
in the great gallery," he said to them, "and place on them all
I have entrusted to your care, in order to render me an account."
These orders were executed immediately. The tables were
covered with an immense quantity of rich stuffs, silks and velvets
of all colours, costly furs, rich copes and other ecclesiastical
vestures; the walls were hung with cloth of gold and silver,
and webs of a valuable stuff named baudykin,<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> from the looms
of Damascus, and with tapestry, representing scriptural subjects
or stories from the old romances of chivalry. The gilt chamber
and the council chamber, adjoining the gallery, were both filled
with plate, in which the gold and silver were set with pearls and
precious stones: these articles of luxury were so abundant that
basketfulls of costly plate, which had fallen out of fashion were
stowed away under the tables. On every table was an exact
list of the treasures with which it was loaded, for the most perfect
order and regularity prevailed in the cardinal's household.
Wolsey cast a glance of hope upon this wealth, and ordered his
officers to deliver the whole to his majesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY LEAVES WHITEHALL.</div>

<p>He then prepared to leave his magnificent palace. That
moment of itself so sad, was made sadder still by an act of affectionate
indiscretion. "Ah, my lord," said his treasurer, Sir
William Gascoigne, moved even to tears, "your grace will be
sent to the Tower." This was too much for Wolsey: to go and
join his victims!... He grew angry, and exclaimed: "Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
this the best comfort you can give your master in adversity? I
would have you and all such blasphemous reporters know that
it is untrue."</p>

<p>It was necessary to depart; he put round his neck a chain of
gold, from which hung a pretended relic of the true cross; this
was all he took. "Would to God," he exclaimed, as he placed
it on, "that I had never had any other." This he said alluding
to the legate's cross which used to be carried before him with
so much pomp. He descended the back stairs, followed by his
servants, some silent and dejected, others weeping bitterly, and
proceeded to the river's brink, where a barge awaited him.
But, alas! it was not alone. The Thames was covered with innumerable
boats full of men and women. The inhabitants of
London, expecting to see the cardinal led to the Tower, desired
to be present at his humiliation, and prepared to accompany
him. Cries of joy hailing his fall were heard from every side;
nor were the cruellest sarcasms wanting. "The butcher's dog
will bite no more," said some; "look, how he hangs his head."
In truth, the unhappy man, distressed by a sight so new to him,
lowered those eyes which were once so proud, but now were
filled with bitter tears. This man, who had made all England
tremble, was then like a withered leaf carried along the stream.
All his servants were moved; even his fool, William Patch,
sobbed like the rest. "O, wavering and newfangled multitude,"
exclaimed Cavendish, his gentleman usher.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> The hopes of the
citizens were disappointed; the barge, instead of descending the
river, proceeded upwards in the direction of Hampton Court;
gradually the shouts died away, and the flotilla dispersed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S JESTER.</div>

<p>The silence of the river permitted Wolsey to indulge in less
bitter thoughts; but it seemed as if invisible furies were pursuing
him, now that the people had left him. He left his barge
at Putney, and mounting his mule, though with difficulty, proceeded
slowly with downcast looks. Shortly after, upon lifting
his eyes, he saw a horseman riding rapidly down the hill towards
them. "Whom do you think it can be?" he asked of his
attendants. "My lord," replied one of them, "I think it is Sir
Henry Morris." A flash of joy passed through Wolsey's heart.
Was it not Norris, who, of all the king's officers, had shown him
the most respect during his visit to Grafton? Norris came up
with them, saluted him respectfully, and said: "The king bids
me declare that he still entertains the same kindly feelings towards
you, and sends you this ring as a token of his confidence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Wolsey received it with a trembling hand: it was that which
the king was in the habit of sending on important occasions.
The cardinal immediately alighted from his mule, and kneeling
down in the road, raised his hands to heaven with an indescribable
expression of happiness. The fallen man would have
pulled off his velvet under-cap, but unable to undo the strings,
he broke them, and threw it on the ground. He remained on
his knees bareheaded praying fervently amidst profound silence.
God's forgiveness had never caused Wolsey so much pleasure as
Henry's.</p>

<p>Having finished his prayer, the cardinal put on his cap, and
remounted his mule. "Gentle Norris," said he to the king's
messenger, "if I were lord of a kingdom, the half of it would
scarcely be enough to reward you for your happy tidings; but I
have nothing left except the clothes on my back." Then taking
off his gold chain: "Take this," he said, "it contains a
piece of the true cross. In my happier days I would not have
parted with it for a thousand pounds." The cardinal and
Norris separated: but Wolsey soon stopped, and the whole troop
halted on the heath. The thought troubled him greatly that
he had nothing to send to the king; he called Norris back,
and looking round him saw mounted on a sorry horse poor
William Patch, who had lost all his gaiety since his master's
misfortune. "Present this poor jester to the king from me,"
said Wolsey to Norris; "his buffooneries are a pleasure fit for a
prince; he is worth a thousand pounds." Patch, offended at
being treated thus, burst into a violent passion, his eyes flashed
fire, he foamed at the mouth, he kicked and fought, and bit all
who approached him;<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> but the inexorable Wolsey, who looked
upon him merely as a toy, ordered six of his tallest yeomen to
lay hold of him. They carried off the unfortunate creature,
who long continued to utter his piercing cries. At the very
moment when his master had had pity on him, Wolsey, like the
servant in the parable, had no pity on his poor companion in
misfortune.</p>

<p>At last they reached Esher. What a residence compared
with Whitehall!... It was little more than four bare
walls. The most urgent necessaries were procured from the
neighbouring houses, but Wolsey could not adapt himself to this
cruel contrast. Besides, he knew Henry VIII; he knew that he
might send Norris one day with a gold ring, and the executioner
the next with a rope. Gloomy and dejected, he remained seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
in his lonely apartments. On a sudden he would rise from
his seat, walk hurriedly up and down, speak aloud to himself,
and then falling back in his chair, he would weep like a child.
This man who formerly had shaken kingdoms, had been overthrown
in the twinkling of an eye, and was now atoning for his
perfidies in humiliation and terror,&mdash;a striking example of God's
judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CHANCELLOR MORE.</div>

<p>During all this time everybody was in commotion at court.
Norfolk and Suffolk, at the head of the council, had informed
the Star Chamber of the cardinal's disgrace. Henry knew not
how to supply his place. Some suggested the archbishop of
Canterbury; the king would not hear of him. "Wolsey," says
a French writer, "had disgusted the king and all England with
those subjects of two masters who, almost always, sold one to
the other. They preferred a lay minister." "I verily believe
the priests will never more obtain it," wrote Du Bellay. The
name of Sir Thomas More was pronounced. He was a layman,
and that quality, which a few years before would, perhaps, have
excluded him, was now a recommendation. A breath of Protestantism
wafted to the summit of honours one of its greatest
enemies. Henry thought that More, placed between the pope
and his sovereign, would decide in favour of the interests of
the throne, and of the independence of England. His choice
was made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY THREATENED WITH PRÆMUNIRE.</div>

<p>More knew that the cardinal had been thrown aside because
he was not a sufficiently docile instrument in the matter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
divorce. The work required of him was contrary to his convictions;
but the honour conferred on him was almost unprecedented&mdash;very
seldom indeed had the seals been intrusted to a
mere knight.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> He followed the path of ambition and not of
duty; he showed, however, in after-days that his ambition was
of no common sort. It is even probable that, foreseeing the
dangers which threatened to destroy the papal power in England,
More wished to make an effort to save it. Norfolk installed
the new chancellor in the Star Chamber. "His majesty," said
the duke, "has not cast his eyes upon the nobility of the blood,
but on the worth of the person. He desires to show by this
choice that there are among the laity and gentlemen of England,
men worthy to fill the highest offices in the kingdom, to
which, until this hour, bishops and noblemen alone think they
have a right."<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> The Reformation which restored religion to
the general body of the church, took away at the same time
political power from the clergy. The priests had deprived the
people of Christian activity, and the governments of power; the
Gospel restored to both what the priests had usurped. This
result could not but be favourable to the interests of religion;
the less cause kings and their subjects have to fear the intrusion
of clerical power into the affairs of the world, the more will they
yield themselves to the vivifying influence of faith.</p>

<p>More lost no time; never had lord-chancellor displayed such
activity. He rapidly cleared off the cases which were in arrear,
and having been installed on the 26th of October he called on
Wolsey's cause on the 28th or 29th. "The crown of England,"
said the attorney-general, "has never acknowledged any superior
but God.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> Now, the said Thomas Wolsey, legate <i>a latere</i>, has
obtained from the pope certain bulls, by virtue of which he has
exercised since the 28th of August 1523 an authority derogatory
to his majesty's power, and to the rights of his courts of
justice. The crown of England cannot be put under the pope;
and we therefore accuse the said legate of having incurred the
penalties of <i>præmunire</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S REAL CRIME.</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that Henry had other reasons for Wolsey's
disgrace than those pointed out by the attorney-general;
but England had convictions of a higher nature than her sovereign's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Wolsey was regarded as the pope's accomplice, and this
was the cause of the great severity of the public officer and of
the people. The cardinal is generally excused by alleging that
both king and parliament had ratified the unconstitutional
authority with which Rome had invested him; but had not the
powers conferred on him by the pope produced unjustifiable
results in a constitutional monarchy? Wolsey, as papal legate,
had governed England without a parliament; and, as if the nation
had gone back to the reign of John, he had substituted <i>de facto</i>,
if not in theory, the monstrous system of the famous bull <i>Unam
Sanctum</i><a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> for the institution of <i>Magna Charta</i>. The king, and
even the lords and commons, had connived in vain at these
illegalities; the rights of the constitution of England remained
not the less inviolable, and the best of the people had protested
against their infringement. And hence it was that Wolsey,
conscious of his crime, "put himself wholly to the mercy and
grace of the king,"<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> and his counsel declared his ignorance of the
statutes he was said to have infringed. We cannot here allege,
as some have done, the prostration of Wolsey's moral powers;
he could, even after his fall, reply with energy to Henry VIII.
When, for instance, the king sent to demand for the crown his
palace of Whitehall, which belonged to the see of York, the
cardinal answered: "Show his majesty from me that I must
desire him to call to his most gracious remembrance that there
is both a heaven and a hell;" and when other charges besides
those of complicity with the papal aggression were brought against
him, he defended himself courageously, as will be afterwards
seen. If therefore the cardinal did not attempt to justify himself
for infringing the rights of the crown, it was because his
conscience bade him be silent. He had committed one of
the gravest faults of which a statesman can be guilty. Those
who have sought to excuse him have not sufficiently borne in
mind that, since the Great Charter, opposition to Romish aggression
has always characterized the constitution and government
of England. Wolsey perfectly recollected this; and this explanation
is more honourable to him than that which ascribes his
silence to weakness or to cunning.</p>

<p>The cardinal was pronounced guilty, and the court passed
judgment, that by the statute of <i>præmunire</i> his property was
forfeited, and that he might be taken before the king in council.
England, by sacrificing a churchman who had placed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
above kings, gave a memorable example of her inflexible opposition
to the encroachments of the papacy. Wolsey was confounded,
and his troubled imagination conjured up nothing but
perils on every side.</p>

<p>While More was lending himself to the condemnation of his
predecessor, whose friend he had been, another layman of still
humbler origin was preparing to defend the cardinal, and by that
very act to become the appointed instrument to throw down
the convents in England, and to shatter the secular bonds
which united this country to the Roman pontiff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROMWELL'S RESOLUTION.</div>

<p>On the 1st of November, two days after Wolsey's condemnation,
one of his officers, with a prayer-book in his hand, was
leaning against the window in the great hall, apparently absorbed
in his devotions. "Good-morrow," said Cavendish as
he passed him, on his way to the cardinal for his usual morning
duties. The person thus addressed raided his head, and the
gentleman-usher, seeing that his eyes were filled with tears,
asked him: "Master Cromwell, is my lord in any danger?"&mdash;"I
think not," replied Cromwell, "but it is hard to lose in a moment
the labour of a life." In his master's fall Cromwell foreboded
his own. Cavendish endeavoured to console him. "God
willing, this is my resolution," replied Wolsey's ambitious solicitor;
"I intend this afternoon, as soon as my lord has dined, to
ride to London, and so go to court, where I will either make or
mar before I come back again."<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> At this moment Cavendish
was summoned, and he entered the cardinal's chamber.</p>

<p>Cromwell, devoured by ambition, had clung to Wolsey's robe
in order to attain power; but Wolsey had fallen, and the solicitor,
dragged along with him, strove to reach by other means
the object of his desires. Cromwell was one of those earnest
and vigorous men whom God prepares for critical times. Blessed
with a solid judgment and intrepid firmness, he possessed a
quality rare in every age, and particularly under Henry VIII,&mdash;fidelity
in misfortune. The ability by which he was distinguished
was not at all times without reproach: success seems
to have been his first thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROMWELL'S INTERVIEW WITH HENRY.</div>

<p>After dinner Cromwell followed Wolsey into his private
room: "My lord, permit me to go to London, I will endeavour
to save you." A gleam passed over the cardinal's saddened
features.&mdash;"Leave the room," he said to his attendants. He
then had a long private conversation with Cromwell,<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> at the
end of which the latter mounted his horse and set out for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
capital, riding to the assault of power with the same activity as
he had marched to the attack of Rome. He did not hide from
himself that it would be difficult to procure access to the king;
for certain ecclesiastics, jealous of Wolsey, had spoken against
his solicitor at the time of the secularization of the convents,
and Henry could not endure him. But Cromwell knew that
fortune favours the bold, and, carried away by his ambitious
dreams, he galloped on, saying to himself: "One foot in the
stirrup, and my fortune is made!"</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Hales, a zealous Roman-catholic, entertained
a sincere friendship for him; and to this friend Cromwell
applied. Hales proceeded immediately to the palace (2nd
November), where he found a numerous company talking about
the cardinal's ruin. "There was one of his officers," said Hales,
"who would serve your majesty well."&mdash;"Who is he?" asked
Henry.&mdash;"Cromwell."&mdash;"Do not speak to me of that man, I
hate him," replied the king angrily;<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> and upon that all the
courtiers chimed in with his majesty's opinion. This opening
was not very encouraging; but Lord Russell, earl of Bedford,
advancing to the midst of the group around the king, said
boldly:<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> "Permit me, Sir, to defend a man to whom I am indebted
for my life. When you sent me privately into Italy, your
majesty's enemies, having discovered me at Bologna, would have
put me to death, had not Thomas Cromwell saved me. Sir,
since you have now to do with the pope, there is no man
(I think) in all England who will be fitter for your purpose."&mdash;"Indeed!"
said the king; and after a little reflection, he said to
Hales: "Very well then, let your client meet me in Whitehall
gardens." The courtiers and the priests withdrew in great discomfiture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIBERTY SHOULD BE RESTORED TO THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>The interview took place the same day at the appointed spot.
"Sir," said Cromwell to his majesty, "the pope refuses your
divorce.... But why do you ask his consent? Every Englishman
is master in his own house, and why should not you be so
in England? Ought a foreign prelate to share your power with
you? It is true, the bishops make oath to your majesty, but
they make another to the pope immediately after, which absolves
them from the former. Sir, you are but half a king, and
we are but half your subjects.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> This kingdom is a two-headed
monster. Will you bear with such an anomaly any longer?
What! are you not living in an age when Frederick the Wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
and other German princes have thrown off the yoke of Rome?
Do likewise; become once more a king; govern your kingdom in
concert with your lords and commons. Henceforward let Englishmen
alone have any thing to say in England; let not your
subjects' money be cast any more into the yawning gulf of the
Tiber; instead of imposing new taxes on the nation, convert to
the general good those treasures which have hitherto only
served to fatten proud priests and lazy friars. Now is the moment
for action. Rely upon your parliament; proclaim yourself
the head of the church in England. Then shall you see an
increase of glory to your name, and of prosperity to your
people."</p>

<p>Never before had such language been addressed to a king of
England. It was not only on account of the divorce that it
was necessary to break with Rome; it was, in Cromwell's view,
on account of the independence, glory, and prosperity of the
monarchy. These considerations appeared more important to
Henry than those which had hitherto been laid before him;
none of the kings of England had been so well placed as he was
to understand them. When a Tudor had succeeded to the
Saxon, Norman, and Plantagenet kings, a man of the free race
of the Celts had taken on the throne of England the place of
princes submissive to the Roman pontiffs. The ancient British
church, independent of the papacy, was about to rise again
with this new dynasty, and the Celtic race, after eleven centuries
of humiliation, to recover its ancient heritage. Undoubtedly,
Henry had no recollections of this kind; but he worked in conformity
with the peculiar character of his race, without being
aware of the instinct which compelled him to act. He felt that
a sovereign, who submits to the pope, becomes, like King John,
his vassal; and now, after having been the second in his realm,
he desired to be the first.</p>

<p>The king reflected on what Cromwell had said; astonished
and surprised, he sought to understand the new position which
his bold adviser had made for him. "Your proposal pleases
me much," he said; "but can you prove what you assert?"
"Certainly," replied this able politician; "I have with me a
copy of the oath the bishops make to the Roman pontiff." With
these words he drew a paper from his pocket, and placed the
oath before the king's eyes. Henry, jealous of his authority
even to despotism, was filled with indignation, and felt the
necessity of bringing down that foreign authority which dared
dispute the power with him, even in his own kingdom. He drew off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
his ring and gave it to Cromwell, declaring that he took him into
his service, and soon after made him a member of his privy-council.
England, we may say, was now virtually emancipated
from the papacy.</p>

<p>Cromwell had laid the first foundations of his greatness. He
had remarked the path his master had followed, and which had
led to his ruin,&mdash;complicity with the pope; and he hoped to
succeed by following the contrary course, namely, by opposing
the papacy. He had the king's support, but he wanted more.
Possessing a clear and easy style of eloquence, he saw what influence
a seat in the great council of the nation would give
him. It was somewhat late, for the session began on the next
day (3rd November), but to Cromwell nothing was impossible.
The son of his friend, Sir Thomas Rush, had been returned to
parliament; but the young member resigned his seat, and Cromwell
was elected in his place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>Parliament had not met for seven years, the kingdom having
been governed by a prince of the Roman church. The reformation
of the church, whose regenerating influence began to be felt
already, was about to restore to the nation those ancient liberties
of which a cardinal had robbed it; and Henry being on the
point of taking very important resolutions, felt the necessity of
drawing nearer to his people. Everything betokened that a
good feeling would prevail between the parliament and the
crown, and that "the priests would have a terrible fright."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p>While Henry was preparing to attack the Roman church in
the papal supremacy, the commons were getting ready to war
against the numerous abuses with which it had covered England.
"Some even thought," says Tyndale, "that this assembly
would reform the church, and that the golden age would
come again."<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> But it was not from acts of parliament that the
Reformation was destined to proceed, but solely from the word
of God. And yet the commons, without touching upon doctrine,
were going to do their duty manfully in things within the
province, and the parliament of 1529 may be regarded (Lord
Herbert of Cherbury observes) as the first protestant parliament
of England.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> "The bishops require excessive fines for the
probates of wills," said Tyndale's old friend, Sir Henry Guilford.
"As testamentary executor to Sir William Compton I had to
pay a thousand marks sterling."&mdash;"The spiritual men," said
another member, "would rather see the poor orphans die of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
hunger than give them the lean cow, the only thing their father
left them."<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>&mdash;"Priests," said another, "have farms, tanneries,
and warehouses, all over the country. In short, the clerks
take everything from their flocks, and not only give them nothing,
but even deny them the word of God."</p>

<p>The clergy were in utter consternation. The power of the nation
seemed to awaken in this parliament for the sole purpose of
attacking the power of the priest. It was important to ward
off these blows. The convocation of the province of Canterbury,
assembling at Westminster on the 5th of November, thought it
their duty, in self-defence, to reform the most crying abuses.
It was therefore decreed, on the 12th of November, that the
priests should no longer keep shops or taverns, play at dice or
other forbidden games, pass the night in suspected places, be
present at disreputable shows,<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> go about with sporting dogs, or
with hawks, falcons, or other birds of prey, on their fist;<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> or, finally,
hold suspicious intercourse with women.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> Penalties were denounced
against these various disorders; they were doubled in
case of adultery; and still further increased in the case of more
abominable impurities.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> Such were the laws rendered necessary
by the manners of the clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE BILLS OF REFORM.</div>

<p>These measures did not satisfy the commons. Three bills
were introduced having reference to the fees on the probate of
wills, mortuaries, pluralities, non-residence, and the exercise of
secular professions. "The destruction of the church is aimed
at," exclaimed Bishop Fisher, when these bills were carried to
the lords, "and if the church falls, the glory of the kingdom
will perish. Lutheranism is making great progress amongst us,
and the savage cry that has already echoed in Bohemia, <i>Down
with the church</i>, is now uttered by the commons.... How
does that come about? Solely from want of faith.&mdash;My lords,
save your country! save the church!" Sir Thomas Audley, the
speaker, with a deputation of thirty members, immediately went
to Whitehall. "Sir," they said to the king, "we are accused of being
without faith, and of being almost as bad as the <i>Turks</i>. We
demand an apology for such offensive language." Fisher pretended
that he only meant to speak of the <i>Bohemians</i>; and the commons,
by no means satisfied, zealously went on with their reforms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>These the king was resolved to concede; but he determined to
take advantage of them to present a bill making over to him
all the money borrowed of his subjects. John Petit, one of the
members for the city, boldly opposed this demand. "I do not
know other persons' affairs," he said, "and I cannot give what
does not belong to me. But as regards myself personally, I
give without reserve all that I have lent the king." The royal
bill passed, and the satisfied Henry gave his consent to the bills
of the commons. Every dispensation coming from Rome, which
might be contrary to the statutes, was strictly forbidden. The
bishops exclaimed that the commons were becoming schismatical;
disturbances were excited by certain priests; but the clerical
agitators were punished, and the people, when they heard of it,
were delighted beyond measure.</p>

<p>The moment when Henry aimed his first blows at Rome was
also that in which he began to shed the blood of the disciples of
the gospel. Although ready to throw off the authority of the
pope, he would not recognise the authority of Christ: obedience
to the Scriptures is, however, the very soul of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY OF THE BELIEVERS.</div>

<p>The king's contest with Rome had filled the friends of Scripture
with hope. The artisans and tradesmen, particularly those
who lived near the sea, were almost wholly won over to the
gospel. "The king is one of us," they used to boast; "he wishes
his subjects to read the New Testament. Our faith, which is the
true one, will circulate through the kingdom, and by Michaelmas
next those who believe as we do will be more numerous
than those of a contrary opinion. We are ready, if needs be; to
die in the struggle."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> This was indeed to be the fate of many.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM OF THE CLERGY&mdash;THE BISHOP'S DEMAND.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>Language such as this aroused the clergy: "The last hour
has come," said Stokesley, who had been raised to the See of
London after Tonstall's translation to Durham; "if we would
not have Luther's heresy pervade the whole of England, we
must hasten to throw it in the sea." Henry was fully disposed
to do so; but as he was not on very good terms with the clergy,
a man was wanted to serve as mediator between him and the
bishops. He was soon found.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More's noble understanding was then passing from
ascetic practices to fanaticism, and the humanist turning into
an inquisitor. In his opinion, the burning of heretics was just
and necessary.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> He has even been reproached with binding
evangelical Christians to a tree in his garden, which he called
"the tree of truth," and of having flogged them with his own
hand.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> More has declared that he never gave "stripe nor stroke,
nor so much as a fillip on the forehead," to any of his religious
adversaries;<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> and we willingly credit his denial. All must be
pleased to think that if the author of the <i>Utopia</i> was a severe
judge, the hand which held one of the most famous pens of the
sixteenth century never discharged the duties of an executioner.</p>

<p>The bishops led the attack. "We must clear the Lord's field
of the thorns which choke it," said the archbishop of Canterbury
to Convocation on the 29th of November 1529; immediately
after which the bishop of Bath read to his colleagues the list of
books that he desired to have condemned. There were a number
of works by Tyndale, Luther, Melancthon, Zwingle, &OElig;colampadius,
Pomeranus, Brentius, Bucer, Jonas, Francis Lambert,
Fryth, and Fish.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> The Bible in particular was set down. "It
is impossible to translate the Scripture into English," said one
of the prelates.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>&mdash;"It is not lawful for the laity to read it in
their mother tongue," said another.&mdash;"If you tolerate the Bible,"
added a third, "you will make us all heretics."&mdash;"By circulating
the Scriptures," exclaimed several, "you will raise up the nation
against the king." Sir T. More laid the bishops' petition before
the king, and some time after, Henry gave orders by proclamation,
that "no one should preach, or write any book, or keep any
school without his bishop's license;&mdash;that no one should keep any
heretical book in his house;&mdash;that the bishops should detain the
offenders in prison at their discretion, and then proceed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
execution of the guilty;&mdash;and, finally, that the chancellor, the
justices of the peace, and other magistrates, should aid and assist
the bishops."<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> Such was the cruel proclamation of Henry VIII,
"the <i>father</i> of the English Reformation."</p>

<p>The clergy were not yet satisfied. The blind and octogenarian
bishop of Norwich, being more ardent than the youngest of his
priests, recommenced his complaints. "My diocese is <i>accumbered</i>
with such as read the Bible," said he to the archbishop of Canterbury,
"and there is not a clerk from Cambridge but <i>savoureth
of the frying-pan</i>. If this continues any time, they will undo
us all. We must have greater authority to punish them
than we have."</p>

<p>Consequently, on the 24th of May 1530, More, Warham,
Tonstall, and Gardiner, having been admitted into St. Edward's
chamber at Westminster, to make a report to the king concerning
heresy, they proposed forbidding, in the most positive manner,
the New Testament and certain other books in which the
following doctrines were taught: "That Christ has shed his
blood for our iniquities, as a sacrifice to the Father.&mdash;Faith only
doth justify us.&mdash;Faith without good works is no little or weak
faith, it is no faith.&mdash;Labouring in good works to come to heaven,
thou dost shame Christ's blood."<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LATIMER SEEKS CHRIST'S VOICE.</div>

<p>Whilst nearly every one in the audience-chamber supported
the prayer of the petition, there were three or four doctors who
kept silence. At last one of them, it was Latimer, opposed the
proposition. Bilney's friend was more decided than ever to
listen to no other voice than God's. "Christ's sheep hear no
man's voice but Christ's," he answered Dr. Redman, who had
called upon him to submit to the church; "trouble me no more
from the talking with the Lord my God."<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> The church, in
Latimer's opinion, presumed to set up its own voice in the place
of Christ's, and the Reformation did the contrary; this was his
abridgement of the controversy. Being called upon to preach
during Christmas tide, he had censured his hearers because they
celebrated that festival by playing at cards, like mere worldlings,
and then proceeded to lay before their eyes Christ's <i>cards</i>,
that is to say, his laws.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> Being placed on the Cambridge commission
to examine into the question of the king's marriage, he
had conciliated the esteem of Henry's deputy, Doctor Butts, the
court physician, who had presented him to his master, by whose
orders he preached at Windsor.</p>

<p>Henry felt disposed at first to yield something to Latimer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
"Many of my subjects," said he to the prelates assembled in
St. Edward's hall, "think that it is my duty to cause the Scriptures
to be translated and given to the people." The discussion
immediately began between the two parties;<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> and Latimer concluded
by asking "that the Bible should be permitted to circulate
freely in English."<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>&mdash;"But the most part overcame the
better," he tells us.<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> Henry declared that the teaching of the
priests was sufficient for the people, and was content to add,
"that he would give the Bible to his subjects when they renounced
the arrogant pretension of interpreting it according to
their own fancies."&mdash;"Shun these books," cried the priests from
the pulpit, "detest them, keep them not in your hands, deliver
them up to your superiors.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> Or, if you do not, your prince,
who has received from God the sword of justice, will use it to
punish you." Rome had every reason to be satisfied with
Henry VIII. Tonstall, who still kept under lock and key the
Testaments purchased at Antwerp through Packington's assistance,
had them carried to St. Paul's Churchyard, where they
were publicly burnt. The spectators retired shaking the head,
and saying: "The teaching of the priests and of Scriptures must
be in contradiction to each other, since the priests destroy
them." Latimer did more: "You have promised us the word
of God," he wrote courageously to the king, "perform your promise
now rather than to-morrow! The day is at hand when
you shall give an account of your office, and of the blood that
hath been shed with your sword."<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> Latimer well knew that
by such language he hazarded his life; but that he was ready to
sacrifice, as he tells us himself.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PERSECUTION BEGINS.</div>

<p>Persecution soon came. Just as the sun appeared to be rising
on the Reformation, the storm burst forth. "There was not a
stone the bishops left unremoved," says the chronicler, "any
corner unsearched, for the diligent execution of the king's proclamation;
whereupon ensued a grievous persecution and slaughter
of the faithful."<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Hitton, a poor and pious minister of Kent, used to
go frequently to Antwerp to purchase New Testaments. As he
was returning from one of these expeditions, in 1529, the bishop
of Rochester caused him to be arrested at Gravesend, and put
to the cruelest tortures, to make him deny his faith.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> But the
martyr repeated with holy enthusiasm: "Salvation cometh by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
faith and not by works, and Christ giveth it to whomsoever he
willeth."<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> On the 20th of February 1530, he was tied to the
stake and there burnt to death.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BAYFIELD IMPORTS THE NEW TESTAMENT.</div>

<p>Scarcely were Hitton's sufferings ended for bringing the
Scriptures into England, when a vessel laden with New Testaments
arrived at Colchester. The indefatigable Bayfield, who
accompanied these books, sold them in London, went back to
the continent, and returned to England in November; but this
time the Scriptures fell into the hands of Sir Thomas More.
Bayfield, undismayed, again visited the Low Countries, and soon
reappeared, bringing with him the New Testament and the
works of almost all the Reformers. "How cometh it that
there are so many New Testaments from abroad?" asked Tonstall
of Packington; "you promised me that you would buy
them all."&mdash;"They have printed more since," replied the wily
merchant; "and it will never be better so long as they have letters
and stamps [types and dies]. My lord, you had better
buy the stamps too, and so you shall be sure."<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p>Instead of the stamps, the priests sought after Bayfield. The
bishop of London could not endure this godly man. Having
one day asked Bainham (who afterwards suffered martyrdom)
whether he knew <i>a single individual</i> who, since the days of the
apostles, had lived according to the true faith in Jesus Christ,
the latter answered: "Yes, I know Bayfield."<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> Being tracked
from place to place, he fled from the house of his pious hostess,
and hid himself at his binder's, where he was discovered, and
thrown into the Lollard's tower.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>As he entered the prison, Bayfield noticed a priest named
Patmore, pale, weakened by suffering, and ready to sink under
the ill-treatment of his jailers. Patmore, won over by Bayfield's
piety, soon opened his heart to him. When rector of Haddam,
he had found the truth in Wickliffe's writings. "They have
burnt his bones," he said, "but from his ashes shall burst forth
a well-spring of life."<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Delighting in good works, he used to fill
his granaries with wheat, and when the markets were high, he
would send his corn to them in such abundance as to bring
down the prices.<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> "It is contrary to the law of God to burn
heretics," he said; and growing bolder, he added: "I care no
more for the pope's curse than for a bundle of hay."<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>His curate, Simon Smith, unwilling to imitate the disorderly
lives of the priests, and finding Joan Bennore, the rector's servant,
to be a discreet and pious person, desired to marry her.
"God," said Patmore, "has declared marriage lawful for <i>all
men</i>; and accordingly it is permitted to the priests in foreign
parts."<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> The rector alluded to Wittemberg, where he had
visited Luther. After his marriage Smith and his wife quitted
England for a season, and Patmore accompanied them as far as
London.</p>

<p>The news of this marriage of a priest&mdash;a fact without precedent
in England&mdash;made Stokesley throw Patmore into the
Lollards' tower, and although he was ill, neither fire, light, nor
any other comfort was granted him. The bishop and his vicar-general
visited him alone in his prison, and endeavoured by their
threats to make him deny his faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAYFIELD IN THE COAL-CELLAR.</div>

<p>It was during these circumstances that Bayfield was thrust
into the tower. By his Christian words he revived Patmore's
languishing faith,<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> and the latter complained to the king that
the bishop of London prevented his feeding the flock which God
had committed to his charge. Stokesley, comprehending whence
Patmore derived his new courage,<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> removed Bayfield from the
Lollards' tower, and shut him up in the coal-house, where he
was fastened upright to the wall by the neck, middle, and legs.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>
The unfortunate gospeller of Bury passed his time in continual
darkness, never lying down, never seated, but nailed as it were
to the wall, and never hearing the sound of human voice. We
shall see him hereafter issuing from this horrible prison to die
on the scaffold.</p>

<p>Patmore was not the only one in his family who suffered
persecution; he had in London a brother named Thomas, a
friend of John Tyndale, the younger brother of the celebrated
reformer. Thomas had said that the truth of Scripture was at
last reappearing in the world, after being hidden for many ages;<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>
and John Tyndale had sent five marks to his brother William,
and received letters from him. Moreover, the two friends (who
were both tradesmen) had distributed a great number of Testaments
and other works. But their faith was not deeply rooted,
and it was more out of sympathy for their brothers that they
had believed; accordingly, Stokesley so completely entangled
them, that they confessed their "crime." More, delighted at
the opportunity which offered to cover the name of Tyndale with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
shame, was not satisfied with condemning the two friends to
pay a fine of £100 each; he invented a new disgrace. He sewed
on their dress some sheets of the New Testament which they
had circulated, placed the two penitents on horseback with their
faces towards the tail, and thus paraded them through the
streets of London, exposed to the jeers and laughter of the
populace. In this, More succeeded better than in his refutation
of the reformer's writings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDWARD FREESE GOES MAD.</div>

<p>From that time the persecution became more violent. Husbandmen,
artists, tradespeople, and even noblemen, felt the
cruel fangs of the clergy and of Sir Thomas More. They sent
to jail a pious musician who used to wander from town to town,
singing to his harp a hymn in commendation of Martin Luther
and of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> A painter, named Edward Freese, a
young man of ready wit, having been engaged to paint some
hangings in a house, wrote on the borders certain sentences of
the Scripture. For this he was seized and taken to the bishop
of London's palace at Fulham, and there imprisoned, where his
chief nourishment was bread made out of sawdust.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> His poor
wife, who was pregnant, went down to Fulham to see her husband;
but the bishop's porter had orders to admit no one, and
the brute gave her so violent a kick, as to kill her unborn infant,
and cause the mother's death not long after. The unhappy
Freese was removed to the Lollards' tower, where he was
put into chains, his hands only being left free. With these he
took a piece of coal, and wrote some pious sentences on the
wall: upon this he was manacled; but his wrists were so severely
pinched, that the flesh grew up higher than the irons. His intellect
became disturbed; his hair in wild disorder soon covered
his face, through which his eyes glared fierce and haggard. The
want of proper food, bad treatment, his wife's death, and his
lengthened imprisonment, entirely undermined his reason.
When brought to St. Paul's, he was kept three days without
meat; and when he appeared before the consistory the poor
prisoner, silent and scarce able to stand, looked around and
gazed upon the spectators, "like a wild man." The examination
was begun, but to every question put to him Freese made
the same answer: "My Lord is a good man." They could get
nothing from him but this affecting reply. Alas! the light
shone no more upon his understanding, but the love of Jesus
was still in his heart. He was sent back to Bearsy Abbey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
where he did not remain long; but he never entirely recovered
his reason.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> Henry VIII and his priests inflicted punishments
still more cruel even than the stake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGITATION IN EXETER.</div>

<p>Terror began to spread far and wide. The most active evangelists
had been compelled to flee to a foreign land; some of the
most godly were in prison; and among those in high station there
were many, and perhaps Latimer was one, who seemed willing
to shelter themselves under an exaggerated moderation. But
just as the persecution in London had succeeded in silencing the
most timid, other voices more courageous were raised in the
provinces. The city of Exeter was at that time in great agitation;
placards had been discovered on the gates of the cathedral
containing some of the principles "of the new doctrine." While
the mayor and his officers were seeking after the author of these
"blasphemies," the bishop and all his doctors, "as hot as coals,"
says the chronicler,<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> were preaching in the most fiery style.
On the following Sunday, during the sermon, two men who had
been the busiest of all the city in searching for the author of
the bills, were struck by the appearance of a person seated near
them. "Surely, this fellow is the heretic," they said. But their
neighbour's devotion, for he did not take his eyes off his book,
quite put them out; they did not perceive that he was reading
the New Testament in Latin.</p>

<p>This man, Thomas Bennet, was indeed the offender. Being
converted at Cambridge by the preaching of Bilney, whose friend
he was, he had gone to Torrington for fear of the persecution,
and thence to Exeter, and after marrying to avoid unchastity
(as he says)<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> he became schoolmaster. Quiet, humble, courteous
to every body, and somewhat timid, Bennet had lived six
years in that city without his faith being discovered. At last
his conscience being awakened he resolved to fasten by night to
the cathedral gates certain evangelical placards. "Every body
will read the writing," he thought, "and nobody will know the
writer." He did as he had proposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT CURSE.</div>

<p>Not long after the Sunday on which he had been so nearly
discovered, the priests prepared a great pageant, and made ready
to pronounce against the unknown heretic the great curse "with
book, bell, and candle." The cathedral was crowded, and
Bennet himself was among the spectators. In the middle stood
a great cross on which lighted tapers were placed, and around it
were gathered all the Franciscans and Dominicans of Exeter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
One of the priests having delivered a sermon on the words:
<i>There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> the
bishop drew near the cross and pronounced the curse against
the offender. He took one of the tapers and said: "Let the
soul of the unknown heretic, if he be dead already, be quenched
this night in the pains of hell-fire, as this candle is now quenched
and put out;" and with that he put out the candle. Then,
taking off a second, he continued: "and let us pray to God, if
he be yet alive, that his eyes be put out, and that all the senses
of his body may fail him, as now the light of this candle is
gone;" extinguishing the second candle. After this, one of the
priests went up to the cross and struck it, when the noise it
made in falling re-echoing along the roof, so frightened the
spectators that they uttered a shriek of terror, and held up their
hands to heaven, as if to pray that the divine curse might not
fall on them. Bennet, a witness of this comedy, could not forbear
smiling. "What are you laughing at?" asked his neighbours;
"here is the heretic, here is the heretic, hold him fast."
This created great confusion among the crowd, some shouting,
some clapping their hands, others running to and fro; but, owing
to the tumult, Bennet succeeded in making his escape.</p>

<p>The excommunication did but increase his desire to attack
the Romish superstitions; and accordingly, before five o'clock
the next morning (it was in the month of October 1530,) his
servant-boy fastened up again by his orders on the cathedral
gates some placards similar to those which had been torn down.
It chanced that a citizen going to early mass saw the boy, and
running up to him, caught hold of him and pulled down the
papers; and then dragging the boy with the one hand, and with
the placards in the other, he went to the mayor of the city.
Bennet's servant was recognised; his master was immediately
arrested, and put in the stocks, "with as much favour as a dog
would find," says Foxe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BENNET'S MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>Exeter seemed determined to make itself the champion of
sacerdotalism in England. For a whole week, not only the
bishop, but all the priests and friars of the city, visited Bennet
night and day. But they tried in vain to prove to him that the
Roman church, was the true one. "God has given me grace to
be of a better church," he said.&mdash;"Do you not know that ours
is built upon St. Peter?"&mdash;"The church that is built upon a
man," he replied, "is the devil's church and not God's." His
cell was continually thronged with visitors; and, in default of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
arguments, the most ignorant of the friars called the prisoner a
heretic, and spat upon him. At length they brought to him a
learned doctor of theology, who, they supposed, would infallibly
convert him. "Our ways are God's ways," said the doctor
gravely. But he soon discovered that theologians can do nothing
against the word of the Lord. "He only is my way," replied
Bennet, "who saith, <i>I am the way, the truth, and the life</i>. In his
<i>way</i> will I walk;&mdash;his <i>truth</i> will I embrace;&mdash;his everlasting
<i>life</i> will I seek."</p>

<p>He was condemned to be burnt; and More having transmitted
the order <i>de comburendo</i> with the utmost speed, the priests
placed Bennet in the hands of the sheriff on the 15th of January,
1531, by whom he was conducted to the Livery-dole, a field
without the city, where the stake was prepared. When Bennet
arrived at the place of execution, he briefly exhorted the people,
but with such unction, that the sheriff's clerk, as he heard him,
exclaimed: "Truly this is a servant of God." Two persons,
however, seemed unmoved: they were Thomas Carew and John
Barnehouse, both holding the station of gentlemen. Going up
to the martyr, they exclaimed in a threatening voice: "Say,
<i>Precor sanctam Mariam et omnes sanctos Dei</i>."&mdash;"I know no
other advocate but Jesus Christ," replied Bennet. Barnehouse
was so enraged at these words, that he took a furze-bush upon
a pike, and setting it on fire, thrust it into the martyr's face,
exclaiming: "Accursed heretic, pray to our Lady, or I will
make you do it."&mdash;"Alas!" replied Bennet patiently, "trouble
me not;" and then holding up his hands, he prayed: "Father,
forgive them!" The executioners immediately set fire to the
wood, and the most fanatical of the spectators, both men and
women, seized with an indescribable fury, tore up stakes and
bushes, and whatever they could lay their hands on, and flung
them all into the flames to increase their violence. Bennet,
lifting up his eyes to heaven, exclaimed: "Lord, receive my
spirit." Thus died, in the sixteenth century, the disciples of
the Reformation sacrificed by Henry VIII.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN PETIT, M. P. FOR LONDON.</div>

<p>The priests, thanks to the king's sword, began to count on
victory; yet schoolmasters, musicians, tradesmen, and even
ecclesiastics, were not enough for them. They wanted nobler
victims, and these were to be looked for in London. More himself,
accompanied by the lieutenant of the Tower, searched many
of the suspected houses.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> Few citizens were more esteemed in
London than John Petit, the same who, in the house of commons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
had so nobly resisted the king's demand about the loan.
Petit was learned in history and in Latin literature: he spoke
with eloquence, and for twenty years had worthily represented
the city. Whenever any important affair was debated in parliament,
the king, feeling uneasy, was in the habit of inquiring
which side he took? This political independence, very rare in
Henry's parliaments, gave umbrage to the prince and his ministers.
Petit, the friend of Bilney, Fryth, and Tyndale, had been
one of the first in England to taste the sweetness of God's word,<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
and had immediately manifested that beautiful characteristic
by which the gospel-faith makes itself known, namely, charity.
He abounded in almsgiving, supported a great number of poor
preachers of the gospel in his own country and beyond the seas;
and whenever he noted down these generous aids in his books,
he wrote merely the words: "Lent unto Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> He, moreover,
forbade his testamentary executors to call in these debts.</p>

<p>Petit was tranquilly enjoying the sweets of domestic life in
his modest home in the society of his wife and two daughters,
Blanche and Audrey, when he received an unexpected visit. One
day, as he was praying in his closet, a loud knock was heard at
the street-door. His wife ran to open it, but seeing Lord-chancellor
More, she returned hurriedly to her husband, and told
him that the lord-chancellor wanted him. More, who followed
her, entered the closet, and with inquisitive eye ran over the
shelves of the library, but could find nothing suspicious. Presently
he made as if he would retire, and Petit accompanied him.
The chancellor stopped at the door and said to him: "You
assert that you have none of these new books?"&mdash;"You have
seen my library," replied Petit.&mdash;"I am informed, however,"
replied More, "that you not only read them, but pay for the
printing." And then he added in a severe tone: "Follow the
lieutenant." In spite of the tears of his wife and daughters
this independent member of parliament was conducted to the
Tower, and shut up in a damp dungeon where he had nothing
but straw to lie upon. His wife went thither each day in vain,
asking, with tears, permission to see him, or at least to send him
a bed. The jailors refused her every thing; and it was only when
Petit fell dangerously ill that the latter favour was granted him.
This took place in 1530, sentence was passed in 1531;<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> we shall
see Petit again in his prison. He left it, indeed, but only to
sink under the cruel treatment he had there experienced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BILNEY RECOVERS FROM HIS FALL.</div>

<p>Thus were the witnesses to the truth struck down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
priests, by Sir Thomas More, and by Henry VIII. A new victim
was to be the cause of many tears. A meek and humble
man, one dear to all the friends of the gospel, and whom we may
regard as the spiritual father of the Reformation in England
was on the point of mounting the burning pile raised by his persecutors.
Some time prior to Petit's appearance before his
judges, which took place in 1531, an unusual noise was heard
in the cell above him; it was Thomas Bilney whom they were
conducting to the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> We left him at the end of 1528,
after his fall. Bilney had returned to Cambridge tormented by
remorse; his friends in vain crowded round him by night and by
day; they could not console him, and even the Scriptures seemed
to utter no voice but that of condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> Fear made him
tremble constantly, and he could scarcely eat or drink. At
length a heavenly and unexpected light dawned in the heart of
the fallen disciple; a witness whom he had vexed&mdash;the Holy
Spirit&mdash;spoke once more in his heart. Bilney fell at the foot of
the cross, shedding floods of tears, and there he found peace.
But the more God comforted him, the greater seemed his crime.
One only thought possessed him, that of giving his life for the
truth. He had shrunk from before the burning pile; its flames
must now consume him. Neither the weakness of his body,
which his long anguish had much increased, nor the cruelty of
his enemies, nor his natural timidity, nothing could stop him:
he strove for the martyr's crown. At ten o'clock one night,
when every person in Trinity Hall was retiring to rest, Bilney
called his friends round him, reminded them of his fall, and
added: "You shall see me no more.... Do not stay
me: my decision is formed, and I shall carry it out. My face
is set to go to Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Bilney repeated the words used
by the evangelist, when he describes Jesus going up to the city
where he was to be put to death. Having shaken hands with
his brethren, this venerable man, the foremost of the evangelists
of England in order of time, left Cambridge under cover of the
night, and proceeded to Norfolk, to confirm in the faith those
who had believed, and to invite the ignorant multitude to the
Saviour. We shall not follow him in this last and solemn ministry;
these facts and others of the same kind belong to a later
date. Before the year 1531 closed in, Bilney, Bainham, Bayfield,
Tewkesbury, and many others, struck by Henry's sword,
sealed by their blood the testimony rendered by them to the
perfect grace of Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S TERROR.</div>

<p>While many pious Christians were languishing in the prisons
of England, the great antagonist of the Reformation was disappearing
from the stage of this world. We must return to
Wolsey, who was still detained at Esher.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p>The cardinal, fallen from the summit of honours, was seized
with those panic-terrors usually felt after their disgrace by those
who have made a whole nation tremble, and he fancied an assassin
lay hid behind every door. "This very night," he wrote
to Cromwell on one occasion, "I was as one that should have
died. If I might, I would not fail to come on foot to you,
rather than this my speaking with you shall be put over and
delayed. If the displeasure of my Lady Anne be somewhat
assuaged, as I pray God the same may be, then I pray you exert
all possible means of attaining her favour."<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this, Cromwell hastened down to Esher
two or three days after taking his seat in parliament, and Wolsey,
all trembling, recounted his fears to him. "Norfolk, Suffolk,
and Lady Anne perhaps, desire my death.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> Did not
Thomas a Becket, an archbishop like me, stain the altar with
his blood?"... Cromwell reassured him, and, moved by the
old man's fears, asked and obtained of Henry an order of protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRIEVANCES OF THE PEERS AGAINST WOLSEY.</div>

<p>Wolsey's enemies most certainly desired his death; but it was
from the justice of the three estates, and not by the assassin's
dagger that they sought it. The House of Peers authorized
Sir Thomas More, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and fourteen
other lords, to impeach the cardinal-legate of high treason.
They forgot nothing: that haughty formula, <i>Ego et rex meus</i>, I
and my king, which Wolsey had often employed; his infringement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
of the laws of the kingdom; his monopolizing the church
revenues; the crying injustice of which he had been guilty,&mdash;as,
for instance, in the case of Sir John Stanley, who was sent
to prison until he gave up a lease to the son of a woman who
had borne the cardinal two children; many families ruined to
satisfy his avarice; treaties concluded with foreign powers without
the king's order; his exactions, which had impoverished
England; and the foul diseases and infectious breath with which
he had polluted his majesty's presence.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> These were some of
the forty-four grievances presented by the peers to the king,
and which Henry sent down to the lower house for their consideration.</p>

<p>It was at first thought that nobody in the commons would
undertake Wolsey's defence, and it was generally expected that
he would be given up to the vengeance of the law (as the bill
of impeachment prayed), or, in other words, to the axe of the
executioner. But one man stood up, and prepared, though alone,
to defend the cardinal: this was Cromwell. The members asked
of each other who the unknown man was; he soon made himself
known. His knowledge of facts, his familiarity with the laws,
the force of his eloquence, and the moderation of his language,
surprised the house. Wolsey's adversaries had hardly aimed a
blow before the defender had already parried it. If any charge
was brought forward to which he could not reply, he proposed
an adjournment until the next day, departed for Esher at the
end of the sitting, conferred with Wolsey, returned during the
night, and next morning reappeared in the commons with fresh
arms. Cromwell carried the house with him; the impeachment
failed, and Wolsey's defender took his station among the statesmen
of England. This victory, one of the greatest triumphs of
parliamentary eloquence at that period, satisfied both the ambition
and the gratitude of Cromwell. He was now firmly fixed
in the king's favour, esteemed by the commons, and admired by
the people: circumstances which furnished him with the means
of bringing to a favourable conclusion the emancipation of the
church of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S PRESENT TO WOLSEY.</div>

<p>The ministry, composed of Wolsey's enemies, was annoyed at
the decision of the lower house, and appointed a commission to
examine into the matter. When the cardinal was informed of
this he fell into new terrors. He lost all appetite and desire of
sleep,<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> and a fever attacked him at Christmas. "The cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
will be dead in four days," said his physician to Henry, "if he
receives no comfort shortly from you and Lady Anne."&mdash;"I
would not loose him for twenty thousand pounds," exclaimed
the king. He desired to preserve Wolsey in case his old
minister's consummate ability should become necessary, which
was by no means unlikely. Henry gave the doctor his portrait
in a ring, and Anne, at the king's desire, added the tablet of
gold that hung at her girdle. The delighted cardinal placed
the presents on his bed, and as he gazed on them he felt his
strength return. He was removed from his miserable dwelling
at Esher to the royal palace at Richmond; and before long he
was able to go into the park, where every night he read his
breviary.</p>

<p>Ambition and hope returned with life. If the king desired
to destroy the papal power in England, could not the proud
cardinal preserve it. Might not Thomas Wolsey do under
Henry VIII what Thomas a Becket had done under Henry II.
His see of York, the ignorance of the priests, the superstition
of the people, the discontent of the great,&mdash;all would be of service
to him; and indeed, six years later, 40,000 men were under
arms in a moment in Yorkshire to defend the cause of Rome.
Wolsey, strong in England by the support of the nation, (such,
at least was his opinion,) aided without by the pope and the
continental powers, might give the law to Henry and crush the
Reformation.</p>

<p>The king having permitted him to go to York, Wolsey prayed
for an increase to his archiepiscopal revenues, which amounted,
however, to four thousand pounds sterling.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> Henry granted
him a thousand marks, and the cardinal, shortly before Easter
1530, departed with a train of 160 persons. He thought it was
the beginning of his triumph.</p>

<p>Wolsey took up his abode at Cawood Castle, Yorkshire, one
of his archiepiscopal residences, and strove to win the affections
of the people. This prelate, once "the haughtiest of men," says
George Cavendish, the man who knew him and served him best,
became quite a pattern of affability. He kept an open table,
distributed bounteous alms at his gate, said mass in the village-churches,
went and dined with the neighbouring gentry, gave
splendid entertainments, and wrote to several princes imploring
their help. We are assured that he even requested the pope
to excommunicate Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> All being thus prepared, he
thought he might make his solemn entry into York, preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
to his enthronization, which was fixed for Monday the 5th of
November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY IS ARRESTED BY NORTHUMBERLAND.</div>

<p>Every movement of his was known at court; every action was
canvassed, and its importance exaggerated. "We thought we
had brought him down," some said, "and here he is rising up
again." Henry himself was alarmed. "The cardinal, by his
detestable intrigues," he said, "is conspiring against my crown,
and plotting both at home and abroad;" the king even added,
<i>where</i> and <i>how</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Wolsey's destruction was resolved upon.</p>

<p>The morning after All Saints day (Friday, 2nd November),
the earl of Northumberland, attended by a numerous escort,
arrived at Cawood, where the cardinal was still residing. He
was the same Percy whose affection for Anne Boleyn had been
thwarted by Wolsey; and there may have been design in Henry's
choice. The cardinal eagerly moved forward to meet this unexpected
guest, and, impatient to know the object of his mission,
took him into his bedchamber, under the pretence of changing
his travelling dress.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> They both remained some time standing
at a window without uttering a word; the earl looked confused
and agitated, whilst Wolsey endeavoured to repress his emotion.
But at last, with a strong effort, Northumberland laid his hand
upon the arm of his former master, and with a low voice said:
"My lord, I arrest you for high treason." The cardinal remained
speechless, as if stunned. He was kept a prisoner in
his room.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Wolsey was guilty of the crime with
which he was charged. We may believe that he entertained
the idea of some day bringing about the triumph of the popedom
in England, even should it cause Henry's ruin; but perhaps this
was all. But, an idea is not a conspiracy, although it may
rapidly expand into one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY PREACHES PERSECUTION.</div>

<p>More than three thousand persons (attracted, not by hatred,
like the Londoners, when Wolsey departed from Whitehall, but
by enthusiasm) collected the next day before the castle to salute
the cardinal. "God save your grace!" they shouted on every
side, and a numerous crowd escorted him at night; some carried
torches in their hands, and all made the air re-echo with their
cries. The unhappy prelate was conducted to Sheffield Park,
the residence of the earl of Shrewsbury. Some days after his
arrival, the faithful Cavendish ran to him, exclaiming: "Good
news, my lord! Sir William Kingston and twenty-four of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
guard are come to escort you to his majesty."&mdash;"Kingston!"
exclaimed the cardinal, turning pale, "Kingston!" and then,
slapping his hand on his thigh, he heaved a deep sigh.
This news had crushed his mind. One day a fortune-teller,
whom he consulted, had told him: "<i>you shall have your end
at Kingston</i>;" and from that time the cardinal had carefully
avoided the town of Kingston-on-Thames. But now he thought
he understood the prophecy.... Kingston, constable of the Tower,
was about to cause his death. They left Sheffield Park; but fright
had given Wolsey his death-blow. Several times he was near
falling from his mule, and on the third day, when they reached
Leicester Abbey, he said as he entered: "Father abbot, I am
come hither to leave my bones among you;" and immediately
took to his bed. This was on Saturday the 26th of November.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, tormented by gloomy forebodings, Wolsey
asked what was the time of day. "Past eight o'clock,"
replied Cavendish.&mdash;"That cannot be," said the cardinal, "eight
o'clock.... No! for by eight o'clock you shall lose your
master." At six on Tuesday, Kingston having come to inquire
about his health, Wolsey said to him: "I shall not live long."&mdash;"Be
of good cheer," rejoined the governor of the Tower.&mdash;"Alas,
Master Kingston", exclaimed the cardinal, "if I had
served God as diligently as I have served the king, he would not
have given me over in my gray hairs!" and then he added with
downcast head: "This is my just reward." What a judgment
upon his own life!</p>

<p>On the very threshold of eternity (for he had but a few minutes
more to live) the cardinal summoned up all his hatred
against the Reformation, and made a last effort. The persecution
was too slow to please him: "Master Kingston," he said, "attend
to my last request: tell the king that I conjure him in God's
name to destroy this new pernicious sect of Lutherans." And
then, with astonishing presence of mind in this his last hour,
Wolsey described the misfortunes which the Hussites had, in his
opinion, brought upon Bohemia; and then, coming to England,
he recalled the times of Wickliffe and Sir John Oldcastle. He
grew animated; his dying eyes yet shot forth fiery glances. He
trembled lest Henry VIII, unfaithful to the pope, should hold
out his hand to the reformers. "Master Kingston," said he, in
conclusion, "the king should know that if he tolerates heresy,
God will take away his power, and we shall then have mischief
upon mischief ... barrenness, scarcity, and disorder to the
utter destruction of this realm."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOLSEY'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>Wolsey was exhausted by the effort. After a momentary
silence, he resumed with a dying voice: "Master Kingston, farewell!
My time draweth on fast. Forget not what I have said and
charged you withal; for when I am dead ye shall peradventure
understand my words better." It was with difficulty he uttered
these words; his tongue began to falter, his eyes became fixed,
his sight failed him; he breathed his last. At the same minute
the clock struck <i>eight</i>, and the attendants standing round his
bed looked at each other in affright. It was the 29th of November
1530.</p>

<p>Thus died the man once so much feared. Power had been
his idol: to obtain it in the state, he had sacrificed the liberties of
England; and to win it or to preserve it in the church, he had
fought against the Reformation. If he encouraged the nobility
in the luxuries and pleasures of life, it was only to render them
more supple and more servile; if he supported learning, it was
only that he might have a clergy fitted to keep the laity in their
leading-strings. Ambitious, intriguing, and impure of life,
he had been as zealous for the sacerdotal prerogative as the austere
Becket; and by a singular contrast, a shirt of hair was found
on the body of this voluptuous man. The aim of his life had
been to raise the papal power higher than it had ever been before,
at the very moment when the Reformation was attempting
to bring it down; and to take his seat on the pontifical
throne with more than the authority of a Hildebrand. Wolsey,
as pope, would have been the man of his age; and in
the political world he would have done for the Roman primacy
what the celebrated Loyola did for it soon after by his fanaticism.
Obliged to renounce this idea, worthy only of the middle ages,
he had desired at least to save the popedom in his own country;
but here again he had failed. The pilot who had stood in England
at the helm of the Romish church was thrown overboard,
and the ship, left to itself, was about to founder. And yet, even
in death, he did not lose his courage. The last throbs of his
heart had called for victims; the last words from his failing
lips, the last message to his master, his last testament had been
... Persecution. This testament was to be only too faithfully
executed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE.</div>

<p>The epoch of the fall and death of Cardinal Wolsey, which
is the point at which we halt, was not only important, because
it ended the life of a man who had presided over the destinies
of England, and had endeavoured to grasp the sceptre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
world, but it is of especial consequence, because then three
movements were accomplished, from which the great transformation
of the sixteenth century was to proceed. Each of these
movements has its characteristic result.</p>

<p>The first is represented by Cromwell. The supremacy of the
pope in England was about to be wrested from him, as it was
in all the reformed churches. But a step further was taken in
England. That supremacy was transferred to the person of the
king. Wolsey had exercised as vicar-general a power till then
unknown. Unable to become pope at the Vatican, he had
made himself a pope at Whitehall. Henry had permitted his
minister to raise his hierarchical throne by the side of his own.
But he had soon discovered that there ought not to be two
thrones in England, or at least not two kings. He had dethroned
Wolsey; and resolutely seating himself in his place, he
was about to assume at Whitehall that tiara which the ambitious
prelate had prepared for himself. Some persons, when
they saw this, exclaimed, that if the papal supremacy were
abolished, that of the word of God ought alone to be substituted.
And, indeed, the true Reformation is not to be found in this
first movement.</p>

<p>The second, which was essential to the renewal of the church,
was represented by Cranmer, and consisted particularly in re-establishing
the authority of holy Scripture. Wolsey did not
fall alone, nor did Cranmer rise alone: each of these two men
carried with him the systems he represented. The fabric of
Roman traditions fell with the first; the foundations of the holy
Scriptures were laid by the second; and yet, while we render all
justice to the sincerity of the Cambridge doctor, we must not
be blind to his weaknesses, his subserviency, and even a certain
degree of negligence, which, by allowing parasitical plants to
shoot up here and there, permitted them to spread over the
living rock of God's word. Not in this movement, then, was
found the Reformation with all its energy and all its purity.</p>

<p>The third movement was represented by the martyrs. When
the church takes a new life, it is fertilized by the blood of its
confessors; and being continually exposed to corruption, it has
constant need to be purified by suffering.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> Not in the palaces
of Henry VIII, nor even in the councils where the question of
throwing off the papal supremacy was discussed, must we look
for the true children of the Reformation; we must go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Tower of London, to the Lollards' tower of St. Paul's and of
Lambeth, to the other prisons of England, to the bishops' cellars,
to the fetters, the stocks, the rack, and the stake. The
godly men who invoked the sole intercession of Christ Jesus,
the only head of his people, who wandered up and down, deprived
of every thing, gagged, scoffed at, scourged, and tortured,
and who, in the midst of all their tribulations, preserved their
Christian patience, and turned, like their Master, the eyes of
their faith towards Jerusalem:&mdash;these were the disciples of the
Reformation in England. The purest church is the church
under the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN.</div>

<p>The father of this church in England was not Henry VIII.
When the king cast into prison or gave to the flames men like
Hitton, Bennet, Patmore, Petit, Bayfield, Bilney, and so many
others, he was not "the father of the Reformation of England,"
as some have so falsely asserted; he was its executioner.</p>

<p>The church of England was foredoomed to be in its renovation
a church of martyrs; and the true father of this church is
our Father which is in heaven.</p>

p. 47) disputes the interview between these two reformers, but his arguments do not convince
me. We can understand how Luther, at that time busily engaged in his dispute with
Carlstadt, does not mention Tyndale's visit in his letters. But, besides Foxe, there are
other contemporaneous authorities in favour of this fact. Cochlæus, a German well informed
on all the movements of the reformers, and whom we shall presently see on Tyndale's
traces, says of him and Roye: "Duo Angli apostatæ, <i>qui aliquamdiu fuerant Vuitenbergæ</i>."
Two English apostates, who had been for a while at Wittemberg. (p. 123). And Sir Thomas
More, having said that Tyndale had gone to see Luther, Tyndale was content to reply:
"When Mr. More saith Tyndale was confederate with Luther, that is not truth." Answer
to Sir Thos. More's Dialogue, p. 147 (Park. Soc.) He denied the <i>confederation</i>, but not
the <i>visit</i>. If Tyndale had not seen Luther, he would have been more explicit, and would
probably have said that he had never even met him.</p></div>

from Coverdale to Cromwell, which the editor of the "remains" assigns to the year 1527. Mr.
Anderson (Annals of the Bible, i. p. 239), places it four years later, in 1531. Foxe asserts
that Cromwell was at the siege of Rome in May 1527, on the authority of Cranmer and
Cromwell himself (Acts and Mon. v. p. 365). If so, the letter cannot belong to that year;
but 1531 is improbable. I am inclined to think it was written in 1528; but any way there is
a difficulty with the date.</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and

Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
